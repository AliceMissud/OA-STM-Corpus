Brualdi ywords: ax algebra nnegative matrix theory rronÃ¢â¬"Frobenius theory atrix power enspace re We prove that the sequence of eigencones (i.e., cones of nonneg- ative eigenvectors) of positive powers A k of a nonnegative square matrix A is periodic both in max algebra and in nonnegative lin- ear algebra. Using an argument of Pullman, we also show that the Minkowski sum of the eigencones of powers of A is equal to the core of A defined as the intersection of nonnegative column spans of matrix powers, also in max algebra. Based on this, we describe the set of extremal rays of the core. The spectral theory of matrix powers and the theory of matrix core is developed in max algebra and in nonnegative linear algebra simultaneously wherever possible, in order to unify and compare both versions of the same theory.

Introduction The nonnegative reals R + under the usual multiplication give rise to two semirings with addition fined in two ways: first with the usual addition, and second where the role of addition is played maximum. Thus we consider the properties of nonnegative matrices with entries in two semirings, e semiring of nonnegative numbers with usual addition and multiplication called Ã¢â¬Ånonnegative gebraÃ¢â¬ï¿½, and the semiring called Ã¢â¬Åmax(-times) algebraÃ¢â¬ï¿½.

Butkovi cÃâ¡ et al. / Linear Algebra and its Applications 439 (2013) 1929Ã¢â¬"1954 Our chief object of study is the core of a nonnegative matrix A. This concept was introduced by llman in [33], and is defined as the intersection of the cones generated by the columns of matrix wers A k . Pullman provided a geometric approach to the PerronÃ¢â¬"Frobenius theory of nonnegative atrices based on the properties of the core. He investigated the action of a matrix on its core owing that it is bijective and that the extremal rays of the core can be partitioned into periodic bits. In other words, extremal rays of the core of A are nonnegative eigenvectors of the powers of A ssociated with positive eigenvalues). One of the main purposes of the present paper is to extend PullmanÃ¢â¬â¢s core to max algebra, thereby vestigating the periodic sequence of eigencones of max-algebraic matrix powers. However, following e line of [10,11,24], we develop the theory in max algebra and nonnegative algebra simultaneously, order to emphasize common features as well as differences, to provide general (simultaneous) oofs where this is possible. We do not aim to obtain new results, relative to [33,43],onthe ual core of a nonnegative matrix. However, our unifying approach leads in some cases (e.g., The- em 6.5(iii)) to new and more elementary proofs than those given previously. Our motivation is osely related to the LitvinovÃ¢â¬"Maslov correspondence principle [27], viewing the idempotent math- atics (in particular, max algebra) as a Ã¢â¬ÅshadowÃ¢â¬ï¿½ of the Ã¢â¬ÅtraditionalÃ¢â¬ï¿½ mathematics over real and mplex fields. To the authorsÃ¢â¬â¢ knowledge, the core of a nonnegative matrix has not received much attention in ear algebra. However, a more detailed study has been carried out by Tam and Schneider [43], who tended the concept of the core to linear mappings preserving a proper cone. The case when the re is a polyhedral (i.e., finitely generated) cone was examined in detail in [43, Section 3], and the sults were applied to study the case of a nonnegative matrix in [43, Section 4]. This work has found rther applications in the theory of dynamic systems acting on the path space of a stationary Bratteli agram. In particular, Bezuglyi et al. [4] describe and exploit a natural correspondence between er- dic measures and extremals of the core of the incidence matrix of such a diagram. On the other hand, there is much more literature on the related but distinct question of the limit- g sets of homogeneous and non-homogeneous Markov chains in nonnegative algebra; see the books Hartfiel [22] and Seneta [37] and, e.g., the works of Chi [13] and Sierksma [42]. In max alge- a, see the results on the ultimate column span of matrix powers for irreducible matrices (see [7, eorem 8.3.11], [38]), and by Merlet [28] on the invariant max cone of non-homogeneous matrix oducts. The theory of the core relies on the behaviour of matrix powers. In the nonnegative algebra, call the works of Friedland and Schneider [17] and Rothblum and Whittle [34] (on the role of stinguished classes which we call Ã¢â¬Åspectral classesÃ¢â¬ï¿½, algebraic and geometric growth rates, and var- us applications). The theory of max-algebraic matrix powers is similar. However, the max-algebraic wers have a well-defined periodic ultimate behaviour starting after sufficiently large time. This timate behaviour has been known since the work of Cuninghame-Green [15, Theorem 27-9],Co- n et al. [14] (irreducible case), and is described in greater generality and detail, e.g., by Akian, aubert and Walsh [1],Gavalec[21],DeSchutter[36], and the authors [7,39,40] of the present paper. particular, the Cyclicity Theorem of Cohen et al. [2,7,14,23]) implies that extremals of the core split to periodic orbits for any irreducible matrix (see Section 4.2 below). 3 Some results on the eigenvectors of max-algebraic matrix powers have been obtained by ButkovicÃâ¡ d Cuninghame-Green [7,8]. The present paper also aims to extend and complete the research initi- ed in that work. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the basics of irreducible and reducible rronÃ¢â¬"Frobenius theory in max algebra and in nonnegative linear algebra. In Section 3 we formulate e two key results of this paper. The first key result is Main Theorem 1 stating that the matrix re is equal to the Minkowski sum of the eigencones of matrix powers (that is, for each positive teger k, we take the sum of the eigencones associated with A k , and then we sum over all k). TheIn fact, many of the cited works and monographs like [2,7,21,23] are written in the setting of max-plus algebra.How- er, this algebra is isomorphic to the max algebra considered here, so the results can be readily translated to the present ax-times) setting. se pe pa Th be ei an se a th w on Se 2. 2. of fo ou th no of An (u un of co in pr 2) sp tio a W co an ge W {1 ed tr w ca 4P. Butkovi cÃâ¡ et al. / Linear Algebra and its Applications 439 (2013) 1929Ã¢â¬"1954 1931 cond key result is Main Theorem 2 stating that the sequence of eigencones of matrix powers is riodic and defining the period. This section also contains a table of notations used throughout the per. Section 4 is devoted to the proof of Main Theorem 1, taking in Ã¢â¬ÅcreditÃ¢â¬ï¿½ the result of Main eorem 2 (whose proof is deferred to the end of the paper). In Section 5 we explain the relation tween spectral classes of different matrix powers, and how the eigencones associated with general genvalues can be reduced to the case of the greatest eigenvalue, see in particular Theorems 5.4 d 5.7. In Section 6 we describe extremals of the core in both algebras extending [43, Theorem 4.7], e Theorem 6.5. Prior to this result we formulate the FrobeniusÃ¢â¬"Victory Theorems 6.1 and 6.2 giving parallel description of extremals of eigencones in both algebras. In Section 7,ourfirstgoalistoshow at the sequence of eigencones of matrix powers in max algebra is periodic, comparing this result ith the case of nonnegative matrix algebra, see Theorem 7.1. Then we study the inclusion relation eigencones and deduce Main Theorem 2. The key results are illustrated by a pair of examples in ction 8. Preliminaries 1. Nonnegative matrices and associated graphs In this paper we are concerned only with nonnegative eigenvalues and nonnegative eigenvectors a nonnegative matrix. In order to bring our terminology into line with the corresponding theory r max algebra we use the terms eigenvalue and eigenvector in a restrictive fashion appropriate to r semiring point of view. Thus we shall call Ãï¿½ an eigenvalue of a nonnegative matrix A (only) if ere is a nonnegative eigenvector x of A for Ãï¿½.Furtherx will be called an eigenvector (only) if it is nnegative. (In the literature Ãï¿½ is called a distinguished eigenvalue and x a distinguished eigenvector A.) For x Ã¢ËËR n + ,thesupport of x,denotedbysupp(x), is the set of indices where x i &gt; 0. In this paper we are led to state the familiar PerronÃ¢â¬"Frobenius theorem in slightly unusual terms: irreducible nonnegative matrix A has a unique eigenvalue denoted by Ãï¿½ + (A), which is positive nless A is the 1 Ã- 1 matrix 0). Further, the eigenvector x associated with Ãï¿½ + (A) is essentially ique, that is all eigenvectors are multiples of x. The nonnegative multiples of x constitute the cone eigenvectors (in the above sense) V + (A,Ãï¿½ + (A)) associated with Ãï¿½ + (A). A general (reducible) matrix A Ã¢ËË R nÃ-n + may have several nonnegative eigenvalues with associated nes of nonnegative eigenvectors (eigencones), and Ãï¿½ + (A) will denote the biggest such eigenvalue, general. Eigenvalue Ãï¿½ + (A) is also called the principal eigenvalue,andV + (A,Ãï¿½ + (A)) is called the incipal eigencone. Recall that a subset V Ã¢Å â  R n + is called a (convex) cone if 1) ÃÂ±v Ã¢ËË V for all v Ã¢ËË V and ÃÂ± Ã¢ËË R + , u + v Ã¢ËË V for u, v Ã¢ËË V . Note that cones in the nonnegative orthant can be considered as Ã¢â¬Åsub- acesÃ¢â¬ï¿½, with respect to the semiring of nonnegative numbers (with usual addition and multiplica- n). In this vein, a cone V is said to be generated by S Ã¢Å â  R n + if each v Ã¢ËË V can be represented as nonnegative combination v = Ã¢Ë' xÃ¢ËËS ÃÂ± x x where only finitely many ÃÂ± x Ã¢ËË R + are different from zero. hen V is generated (we also say Ã¢â¬ÅspannedÃ¢â¬ï¿½) by S,thisisdenotedV = span + (S). A vector z in a ne V is called an extremal,ifz = u + v and u, v Ã¢ËË V imply z = ÃÂ± u u = ÃÂ± v v for some scalars ÃÂ± u d ÃÂ± v . Any closed cone in R n + is generated by its extremals; in particular, this holds for any finitely nerated cone. Let us recall some basic notions related to (ir)reducibility, which we use also in max algebra. ith a matrix A = (a ij ) Ã¢ËË R nÃ-n + we associate a weighted (di)graph G(A) with the set of nodes N = ,...,n} and set of edges E Ã¢Å â  N Ã- N containing a pair (i, j) if and only if a ij = 0; the weight of an ge (i, j) Ã¢ËË E is defined to be w(i, j) := a ij . A graph with just one node and no edges will be called ivial. A graph with at least one node and at least one edge will be called nontrivial. ApathP in G(A) consisting 4 of the edges (i 0 , i 1 ), (i 1 , i 2 ),...,(i tÃ¢Ë'1 , i t ) has length l(P ) := t and eight w(P ) := w(i 0 , i 1 ) ÃÂ· w(i 1 , i 2 ) ÃÂ·ÃÂ·ÃÂ·w(i tÃ¢Ë'1 , i t ), and is called an i Ã¢Ë' j path if i 0 = i and i t = j. P is lled a cycle if i 0 = i t . P is an elementary cycle, if, further, i k = i l for all k, lÃ¢ËË{1,...,t Ã¢Ë' 1}.In our terminology, a path can visit some nodes more than once. 19 i 2. pl us fo Ã¢Å â¢ co id be di W w z fo Th ed N of a tr co ei ci er ei va m (e Th Se th gr th 2. on32 P. Butkovi cÃâ¡ et al. / Linear Algebra and its Applications 439 (2013) 1929Ã¢â¬"1954 Recall that A = (a ij ) Ã¢ËË R nÃ-n + is irreducible if G(A) is trivial or for any i, j Ã¢ËË{1,...,n} there is an Ã¢Ë' j path. Otherwise A is reducible. Notation A Ã-k will stand for the usual kth power of a nonnegative matrix. 2. Max algebra By max algebra we understand the set of nonnegative numbers R + where the role of addition is ayed by taking maximum of two numbers: a Ã¢Å â¢ b :=max(a,b), and the multiplication is as in the ual arithmetics. This is carried over to matrices and vectors like in the usual linear algebra so that r two matrices A = (a ij ) and B = (b ij ) of appropriate sizes, (A Ã¢Å â¢ B) ij = a ij Ã¢Å â¢ b ij and (A Ã¢Å - B) ij = k a ik b kj .NotationA Ã¢Å -k will stand for the kth max-algebraic power. In max algebra, we have the following analogue of a convex cone. A set V Ã¢Å â  R n + is called a max ne if 1) ÃÂ±v Ã¢ËË V for all v Ã¢ËË V and ÃÂ± Ã¢ËË R + ,2)u Ã¢Å â¢ v Ã¢ËË V for u, v Ã¢ËË V . Max cones are also known as empotent semimodules [26,27]. A max cone V is said to be generated by S Ã¢Å â R n + if each v Ã¢ËË V can represented as a max-combination v = Ã¢Å â¢ xÃ¢ËËS ÃÂ± x x where only finitely many (nonnegative) ÃÂ± x are fferent from zero. When V is generated (we also say Ã¢â¬ÅspannedÃ¢â¬ï¿½) by S,thisisdenotedV = span Ã¢Å â¢ (S). hen V is generated by the columns of a matrix A,thisisdenotedV = span Ã¢Å â¢ (A). This cone is closed ith respect to the usual Euclidean topology [10]. Avectorz in a max cone V Ã¢Å â  R n + is called an extremal if z = u Ã¢Å â¢ v and u, v Ã¢ËË V imply z = u or = v . Any finitely generated max cone is generated by its extremals, see Wagneur [45] and [10,20] r recent extensions. The maximum cycle geometric mean of A is defined by ÃÂ»(A)=max { w(C) 1/l(C) : C is a cycle in G(A) } . (1) e cycles with the cycle geometric mean equal to ÃÂ»(A) are called critical, and the nodes and the ges of G(A) that belong to critical cycles are called critical. The set of critical nodes is denoted by c (A), the set of critical edges by E c (A), and these nodes and edges give rise to the critical graph A,denotedbyC(A) = (N c (A), E c (A)). A maximal strongly connected subgraph of C(A) is called strongly connected component of C(A). Observe that C(A),inA general, consists of several non- ivial strongly connected components, and that it never has any edges connecting different strongly nnected components. If for A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + we have AÃ¢Å - x= Ãï¿½x with Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËR + and a nonzero x Ã¢ËËR n + ,thenÃï¿½ is a max(-algebraic) genvalue and x is a max(-algebraic) eigenvector associated with Ãï¿½ . The set of max eigenvectors asso- ated with Ãï¿½ , with the zero vector adjoined to it, is a max cone. It is denoted by V Ã¢Å â¢ (A,Ãï¿½). An irreducible A Ã¢ËË R nÃ-n + has a unique max-algebraic eigenvalue equal to ÃÂ»(A) [2,7,15,23].Ingen- al A may have several max eigenvalues, and the greatest of them equals ÃÂ»(A). The greatest max genvalue will also be denoted by Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A) (thus Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A) = ÃÂ»(A)), and called the principal max eigen- lue of A. In the irreducible case, the unique max eigenvalue Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A) = ÃÂ»(A) is also called the ax(-algebraic) Perron root. When max algebra and nonnegative algebra are considered simultaneously .g., Section 3), the principal eigenvalue is denoted by Ãï¿½(A). Unlike in nonnegative algebra, there is an explicit description of V Ã¢Å â¢ (A,Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A)), see Theorem 6.2. is description uses the Kleene star A Ã¢Ë- = I Ã¢Å â¢ A Ã¢Å â¢ A Ã¢Å -2 Ã¢Å â¢ A Ã¢Å -3 Ã¢Å â¢ÃÂ·ÃÂ·ÃÂ·. (2) ries (2) converges if and only if Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A) 1, in which case A Ã¢Ë- = I Ã¢Å â¢ AÃ¢Å â¢ÃÂ·ÃÂ·ÃÂ·Ã¢Å â¢A Ã¢Å -(nÃ¢Ë'1) [2,7,23].Note at if Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A) = 0, then Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A/Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A))= 1, hence (A/Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A)) Ã¢Ë- always converges. The path interpretation of max-algebraic matrix powers A Ã¢Å -l is that each entry a Ã¢Å -l ij is equal to the eatest weight of an i Ã¢Ë' j path of length l.Consequently,fori = j,theentrya Ã¢Ë- ij of A Ã¢Ë- is equal to e greatest weight of an i Ã¢Ë' j path (with no length restrictions). 3. Cyclicity and periodicityConsider a nontrivial strongly connected graph G (that is, a strongly connected graph with at least e node and one edge). Define its cyclicity ÃÆ as the gcd of the lengths of all elementary cycles. It is pa pa (in w cl to be a i di al en is m of Ry Th ( (i Co gc se Pr is of co th bu se se qu ex of soP. Butkovi cÃâ¡ et al. / Linear Algebra and its Applications 439 (2013) 1929Ã¢â¬"1954 1933 known that for any vertices i, j there exists a number l such that l(P ) Ã¢â°Â¡ l(mod ÃÆ) for all i Ã¢Ë' j ths P . When the length of an i Ã¢Ë' j path is a multiple of ÃÆ (and hence we have the same for all j Ã¢Ë' i ths), i and j are said to belong to the same cyclic class. When the length of this path is 1 modulo ÃÆ other words, if l(P )Ã¢Ë' 1 is a multiple of ÃÆ ), the cyclic class of i (resp., of j)isprevious (resp., next) ith respect to the class of j (resp., of i). See [7, Chapter 8] and [5,38,39] for more information. Cyclic asses are also known as components of imprimitivity [5]. The cyclicity of a trivial graph is defined to be 1, and the unique node of a trivial graph is defined be its only cyclic class. We define the cyclicity of a (general) graph containing several strongly connected components to the lcm of the cyclicities of the components. For a graph G = (N, E) with N ={1,...,n},definetheassociated matrix A = (a ij )Ã¢ËË{0,1} nÃ-n by j = 1 Ã¢â¡" (i, j) Ã¢ËË E. This is a matrix over the Boolean semiring B := {0,1}, where addition is the sjunction and multiplication is the conjunction operation. This semiring is a subsemiring of max gebra, so that it is possible to consider the associated matrix as a matrix in max algebra whose tries are either 0 or 1. For a graph G and any k 1, define G k as a graph that has the same vertex set as G and (i, j) an edge of G k if and only if there is a path of length k on G connecting i to j. Thus, if a Boolean atrix A is associated with G , then the Boolean matrix power A Ã¢Å -k is associated with G k .Powers Boolean matrices (over the Boolean semiring) are a topic of independent interest, see Brualdi and ser [5],Kim[25]. We will need the following observation. eorem 2.1. (Cf. [5, Theorem 3.4.5].) Let G be a strongly connected graph with cyclicity ÃÆ . i) G k consists of gcd(k, ÃÆ ) strongly connected components not accessing each other. If G is nontrivial, then so are all the components of G k . i) The node set of each component of G k consists of ÃÆ/(gcd(k, ÃÆ )) cyclic classes of G . rollary 2.2. Let G be a strongly connected graph with cyclicity ÃÆ ,andletk, l 1.Thengcd(k, ÃÆ ) divides d(l, ÃÆ ) if and only if G k and G l aresuchthatthenodesetofeverycomponentofG l is contained in the node tofacomponentofG k . oof. Assume that G is nontrivial. Ã¢â¬ÅIf Ã¢â¬ï¿½. Since the node set of each component of G k consists of ÃÆ/gcd(k, ÃÆ ) cyclic classes of G and it the disjoint union of the node sets of certain components of G l , and the node set of each component G l consists of ÃÆ/gcd(l, ÃÆ ) cyclic classes of G , it follows that the node set of each component of G k nsists of ÃÆ gcd(k,ÃÆ ) / ÃÆ gcd(l,ÃÆ ) = gcd(l,ÃÆ ) gcd(k,ÃÆ ) components of G l . In particular, gcd(k, ÃÆ ) divides gcd(l, ÃÆ ). Ã¢â¬ÅOnly if Ã¢â¬ï¿½. Observe that the node sets of the components G k and G gcd(k,ÃÆ ) (or G l and G gcd(l,ÃÆ ) )are e same: since gcd(k, ÃÆ ) divides k, each component of G gcd(k,ÃÆ ) splits into several components of G k , t the total number of components is the same (as gcd(gcd(k, ÃÆ ),ÃÆ )= gcd(k, ÃÆ )), hence their node ts are the same. The claim follows since the node set of each component of G gcd(k,ÃÆ ) splits into veral components of G gcd(l,ÃÆ ) . Let us formally introduce the definitions related to periodicity and ultimate periodicity of se- ences (whose elements are of arbitrary nature). A sequence {Ã¢"Â¦ k } k 1 is called periodic if there ists an integer p such that Ã¢"Â¦ k+p is identical with Ã¢"Â¦ k for all k. The least such p is called the period {Ã¢"Â¦ k } k 1 .Asequence{Ã¢"Â¦ k } k 1 is called ultimately periodic if the sequence {Ã¢"Â¦ k } k T is periodic forme T 1. The least such T is called the periodicity threshold of {Ã¢"Â¦ k } k 1 . The following observation is crucial in the theory of Boolean matrix powers. 19 Th ( (i m Th C Th Ãï¿½ w (r m pe ni Le ex t m 2. eq ze cl ei (N m ha be po a on Th ex34 P.

Let G be a strongly connected graph on n nodes, with cyclicity ÃÆ . i) The sequence {G k } k 1 is ultimately periodic with the period ÃÆ . The periodicity threshold, denoted by T (G), does not exceed (nÃ¢Ë' 1) 2 + 1. i) If G is nontrivial, then for k T (G) and a multiple of ÃÆ , G k consists of ÃÆ complete subgraphs not accessing each other. For brevity, we will refer to T (G) as the periodicity threshold of G . We have the following two ax-algebraic extensions of Theorem 2.3. eorem 2.4 (Cyclicity Theorem). (See Cohen et al. [14].) Let A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + be irreducible, let ÃÆ be the cyclicity of (A) and Ãï¿½ := Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A). Then the sequence {(A/Ãï¿½) Ã¢Å -k } k 1 is ultimately periodic with period ÃÆ . eorem 2.5 (Cyclicity of Critical Part). (See Nachtigall [31].) Let A Ã¢ËË R nÃ-n + , ÃÆ be the cyclicity of C(A) and := Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A). Then the sequences {(A/Ãï¿½) Ã¢Å -k iÃÂ· } k 1 and {(A/Ãï¿½) Ã¢Å -k ÃÂ·i } k 1 , for i Ã¢ËË N c (A),areultimatelyperiodic ith period ÃÆ . The greatest of their periodicity thresholds, denoted by T c (A), does not exceed n 2 . Theorem 2.4 is standard [2,7,23], and Theorem 2.5 can also be found as [7, Theorem 8.3.6].HereA iÃÂ· esp. A ÃÂ·i )denotetheith row (resp. the ith column) of A. When the sequence {(A/Ãï¿½) Ã¢Å -k } k 1 (resp. the sequences {(A/Ãï¿½) Ã¢Å -k iÃÂ· } k 1 , {(A/Ãï¿½) Ã¢Å -k ÃÂ·i } k 1 )areulti- ately periodic, we also say that the sequence {A Ã¢Å -k } k 1 (resp. {A Ã¢Å -k iÃÂ· } k 1 , {A Ã¢Å -k ÃÂ·i } k 1 )isultimately riodic with growth rate Ãï¿½ . Let us conclude with a well-known number-theoretic result concerning the coin problem of Frobe- us, which we see as basic for both Boolean and max-algebraic cyclicity. mma 2.6. (E.g., [5, Lemma 3.4.2].) Let n 1 ,...,n m be integers such that gcd(n 1 ,...,n m ) = k. Then there ists a number T such that for all integers l with kl T, we have kl= t 1 n 1 +ÃÂ·ÃÂ·ÃÂ·+t m n m for some t 1 ,..., 0. 4. Diagonal similarity and visualization For any x Ã¢ËË R n + ,wecandefineX = diag(x) as the diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are ual to the corresponding entries of x, and whose off-diagonal entries are zero. If x does not have ro components, the diagonal similarity scaling A Ã¢â ' X Ã¢Ë'1 AX does not change the weights of cy- es and eigenvalues (both nonnegative and max); if z is an eigenvector of X Ã¢Ë'1 AX then Xz is an genvector of A with the same eigenvalue. This scaling does not change the critical graph C(A) = c (A), E c (A)). Observe that (X Ã¢Ë'1 AX) Ã¢Å -k = X Ã¢Ë'1 A Ã¢Å -k X , also showing that the periodicity thresholds of ax-algebraic matrix powers (Theorems 2.4 and 2.5) do not change after scaling. Of course, we also ve (X Ã¢Ë'1 AX) Ã-k = X Ã¢Ë'1 A Ã-k X in nonnegative algebra. The technique of diagonal similarity scaling can traced back to the works of Fiedler and PtÃÂ¡k [16]. When working with the max-algebraic matrix powers, it is often convenient to Ã¢â¬ÅvisualizeÃ¢â¬ï¿½ the wers of the critical graph. Let A have ÃÂ»(A)= 1. A diagonal similarity scaling A Ã¢â ' X Ã¢Ë'1 AX is called strict visualization scaling [7,41] if the matrix B = X Ã¢Ë'1 AX has b ij 1, and moreover, b ij = 1 if and ly if (i, j) Ã¢ËË E c (A)(= E c (B)).AnymatrixB satisfying these properties is called strictly visualized. eorem 2.7 (Strict Visualization). (See [7,41].) For each A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + with Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A)=1(that is, ÃÂ»(A)= 1),there ists a strict visualization scaling. If A = (a ij ) has all entries a ij 1, then we define the Boolean matrix A [1] with entriesa [1] ij = { 1, if a ij = 1, 0, if a ij &lt; 1.

(4) milarly if a vector x Ã¢ËËR n + has x i 1, we define x [1] having x [1] i =1ifx i = 1 and x [1] i =0otherwise. bviously if A and x have all entries not exceeding 1 then (A Ã¢Å - x) [1] = A [1] Ã¢Å - x [1] . If A is strictly visualized, then a [1] ij = 1 if and only if (i, j) isacriticaledgeofG(A).ThusA [1] can treated as the associated matrix of C(A) (disregarding the formal difference in dimension). We now ow that C(A Ã¢Å -k )= C(A) k and that any power of a strictly visualized matrix is strictly visualized. mma 2.8. (Cf. [8], [38, Proposition 3.3].) Let A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + and k 1. i) C(A) k = C(A Ã¢Å -k ). i) If A is strictly visualized, then so is A Ã¢Å -k . oof. Using Theorem 2.7, we can assume without loss of generality that A is strictly visualized. Also te that both in C(A Ã¢Å -k ) and in C(A) k , each node has ingoing and outgoing edges, hence for part (i) suffices to prove that the two graphs have the same set of edges. Applying Theorem 2.1(i) to every component of C(A), we obtain that C(A) k also consists of several olated nontrivial strongly connected graphs. In particular, each edge of C(A) k lies on a cycle, so A) k contains cycles. Observe that G(A Ã¢Å -k ) does not have edges with weight greater than 1, while l edges of C(A) k have weight 1, hence all cycles of C(A) k have weight 1. As C(A) k is a subgraph G(A Ã¢Å -k ), this shows that Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A Ã¢Å -k ) = ÃÂ»(A Ã¢Å -k ) = 1 and that all cycles of C(A) k are critical cycles G(A Ã¢Å -k ). Since each edge of C(A) k lies on a critical cycle, all edges of C(A) k are critical edges G(A Ã¢Å -k ). G(A Ã¢Å -k ) does not have edges with weight greater than 1, hence every edge of C(A Ã¢Å -k ) has weight 1. . (4) implies that if a Ã¢Å -k ij = 1 then there is a path from i to j composed of the edges with weight 1. nce A is strictly visualized, such edges are critical. This shows that if a Ã¢Å -k ij = 1 and in particular if , j) is an edge of C(A Ã¢Å -k ),then(i, j) is an edge of C(A) k .HenceA Ã¢Å -k is strictly visualized, and all ges of C(A Ã¢Å -k ) are edges of C(A) k . Thus C(A Ã¢Å -k ) and C(A) k have the same set of edges, so C(A Ã¢Å -k )= C(A) k (and we also showed that Ã¢Å -k is strictly visualized). Let T (C(A)) be the greatest periodicity threshold of the strongly connected components of C(A). e following corollary of Lemma 2.8 will be required in Section 7. rollary 2.9. Let A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + .ThenT c (A) T (C(A)). 5. Frobenius normal form Every matrix A = (a ij ) Ã¢ËË R nÃ-n + can be transformed by simultaneous permutations of the rows and lumns in almost linear time to a Frobenius normal form [3,5] Ã¯Â£Â« Ã¯Â£Â¬ Ã¯Â£Â¬ Ã¯Â£Â­ A 11 0 ÃÂ·ÃÂ·ÃÂ· 0 A 21 A 22 ÃÂ·ÃÂ·ÃÂ· 0 ÃÂ·ÃÂ·ÃÂ· ÃÂ·ÃÂ·ÃÂ· A ÃÂµÃÂµ ÃÂ·ÃÂ·ÃÂ· A r1 A r2 ÃÂ·ÃÂ·ÃÂ· A rr Ã¯Â£Â¶ Ã¯Â£Â· Ã¯Â£Â· Ã¯Â£Â¸ , (5) here A 11 ,...,A rr are irreducible square submatrices of A. They correspond to the sets of nodes 1 ,...,N r of the strongly connected components of G(A). Note that in (5) an edge from a node of ÃÂµ to a node of N ÃÂ½ in G(A) may exist only if ÃÂµ ÃÂ½ . Generally, A denotes the submatrix of A extracted from the rows with indices in K Ã¢Å â {1,...,n} KL d columns with indices in L Ã¢Å â {1,...,n}, and A ÃÂµÃÂ½ is a shorthand for A N ÃÂµ N ÃÂ½ . Accordingly, the sub- ctor x N ÃÂµ of x with indices in N ÃÂµ will be written as x ÃÂµ . 19 w N re (n cl is ÃÂµ by be P th ne th tr 2. ne Se ot (A In se m an ar H th co at le 9/ ea si Th 5 6 m36 P.

In max algebra and in nonnegative algebra, the nodes of R(A) are marked by the cor- sponding eigenvalues (Perron roots), denoted by Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ ÃÂµ := Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A ÃÂµÃÂµ ) (max algebra), Ãï¿½ + ÃÂµ := Ãï¿½ + (A ÃÂµÃÂµ ) onnegative algebra), and by Ãï¿½ ÃÂµ when both algebras are considered simultaneously.

Class ÃÂµ accesses class ÃÂ½,denotedÃÂµÃ¢â ' ÃÂ½,if = ÃÂ½ or if there exists a ÃÂµ Ã¢Ë' ÃÂ½ path in R(A). A class is called initial,resp.final, if it is not accessed , resp. if it does not access, any other class. Node i of G(A) accesses class ÃÂ½,denotedbyi Ã¢â ' ÃÂ½,ifi longs to a class ÃÂµ such that ÃÂµÃ¢â ' ÃÂ½ . Note that simultaneous permutations of the rows and columns of A are equivalent to calculating Ã¢Ë'1 AP, where P is a permutation matrix. Such transformations do not change the eigenvalues, and e eigenvectors before and after such a transformation may only differ by the order of their compo- nts. Hence we can assume without loss of generality that A is in Frobenius normal form (5). Note at a permutation bringing matrix to this form is (relatively) easy to find [5]. We will refer to the ansformation A Ã¢â ' P Ã¢Ë'1 AP as permutational similarity. 6. Elements of the PerronÃ¢â¬"Frobenius theory In this section we recall the spectral theory of reducible matrices in max algebra and in non- gative linear algebra. All results are standard: the nonnegative part goes back to Frobenius [18], ction 11, and the max-algebraic counterpart is due to Gaubert [19], Chapter IV (also see [7] for her references). AclassÃÂ½ of A is called a spectral class of A associated with eigenvalue Ãï¿½ = 0, or sometimes ,Ãï¿½)-spectral class for short, if Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ ÃÂ½ = Ãï¿½, and ÃÂµÃ¢â ' ÃÂ½ implies Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ ÃÂµ Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ ÃÂ½ (max algebra), Ãï¿½ + ÃÂ½ = Ãï¿½, and ÃÂµÃ¢â ' ÃÂ½,ÃÂµ = ÃÂ½ implies Ãï¿½ + ÃÂµ &lt; Ãï¿½ + ÃÂ½ (nonnegative algebra). (6) both algebras, note that there may be several spectral classes associated with the same eigenvalue. In nonnegative algebra, spectral classes are called distinguished classes [35], and there are also mi-distinguished classes associated with distinguished generalized eigenvectors of order two or ore [44]. However, these vectors are not contained in the core. 6 Also, no suitable max-algebraic alogue of generalized eigenvectors is known to us. If all classes of A consist of just one element, then the nonnegative and max-algebraic Perron roots e the same. In this case, the spectral classes in nonnegative algebra are also spectral in max algebra. owever, in general this is not so. In particular, for a nonnegative matrix A, a cycle of G(A) attaining e maximum cycle geometric mean Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A)= ÃÂ»(A) need not lie in a strongly connected component rresponding to a class with spectral radius Ãï¿½ + (A).Thisisbecause,ifA 1 , A 2 are irreducible nonneg- ive matrices such that Ãï¿½ + (A 1 )&lt;Ãï¿½ + (A 2 ), then we need not have Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A 1 ) Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A 2 ).Forexample, t A be the 3Ã-3 matrix of all 1Ã¢â¬â¢s, and let B( )= (3/2, , ) T (3/2, , ).ThenÃï¿½ + (A)= 3, Ãï¿½ + (B( ))= 4+ 2 2 ,soÃï¿½ + (A)&gt;Ãï¿½ + (B( )) for sufficiently small &gt; 0, but Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (B( ))= 9/4&gt; 1= Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A). Denote by Ãâº + (A),resp.Ãâº Ã¢Å â¢ (A),thesetofnonzero eigenvalues of A Ã¢ËË R nÃ-n + in nonnegative lin- r algebra, resp. in max algebra. It will be denoted by Ãâº(A) whenbothalgebrasareconsidered multaneously, as in the following standard description. eorem 2.10. (See [7, Theorem 4.5.4], [35, Theorem 3.7].) Let A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + .ThenÃâº(A)={Ãï¿½ ÃÂ½ = 0: ÃÂ½ is spectral}.The sets N ÃÂµ are also called classes, in the literature. To avoid the confusion, we do not follow this in the present paper. For a polyhedral cone, the core of the cone-preserving map does not contain generalized eigenvectors of order two or ore [43, Corollary 4.3]. wth Fr Pr is th th A no 3. al tio Th ta w 7 eig ofP. Butkovi cÃâ¡ et al. / Linear Algebra and its Applications 439 (2013) 1929Ã¢â¬"1954 1937 Theorem 2.10 encodes the following two statements: Ãâº Ã¢Å â¢ (A)= { Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ ÃÂ½ = 0: ÃÂ½ is spectral } ,Ãâº + (A)= { Ãï¿½ + ÃÂ½ = 0: ÃÂ½ is spectral } , (7) here the notion of spectral class is defined in two different ways by (6), in two algebras. In both algebras, for each Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A) define A Ãï¿½ := Ãï¿½ Ã¢Ë'1 ( 00 0 A M Ãï¿½ M Ãï¿½ ) , where M Ãï¿½ := { i: iÃ¢â ' ÃÂ½, ÃÂ½ is (A,Ãï¿½)-spectral } . (8) The next proposition, holding both in max algebra and in nonnegative algebra, allows us to reduce e case of arbitrary eigencone to the case of principal eigencone. Here we assume that A is in obenius normal form. oposition 2.11. (See [7,19,35].) For A Ã¢ËË R nÃ-n + and each Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A),wehaveV(A,Ãï¿½)= V (A Ãï¿½ ,1),where1 the principal eigenvalue of A Ãï¿½ . For a parallel description of extremals of eigencones 7 in both algebras see Section 6.1. In max algebra, using Proposition 2.11,wedefinethecritical graph associated with Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËË Ãâº Ã¢Å â¢ (A) as e critical graph of A Ãï¿½ .Byacritical component of A we mean a strongly connected component of e critical graph associated with some Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËË Ãâº Ã¢Å â¢ (A). In max algebra, the role of spectral classes of is rather played by these critical components, which will be (in analogy with classes of Frobenius rmal form) denoted by ÃÂµÃÅ, with the node set N ÃÂµÃÅ . See Section 5.2. Notation table and key results The following notation table shows how various objects are denoted in nonnegative algebra, max gebra and when both algebras are considered simultaneously.

The core and the sum of eigencones appearing in the table have not been formally introduced. ese are the two central notions of this paper, and we now introduce them for both algebras simul- neously. The core of a nonnegative matrix A is defined as the intersection of the column spans (in other ords, images) of its powers:In nonnegative algebra, [35, Theorem 3.7] immediately describes both spectral classes and eigencones associated with any envalue. However, we prefer to split the formulation, following the exposition of [7]. An alternative simultaneous exposition spectral theory in both algebras can be found in [24]. 19 ve If is an Th th du al of ex no M pr Th re co an M ( (i re ke38 P.

(9) The (Minkowski) sum of eigencones of a nonnegative matrix A is the cone consisting of all sums of ctors in all V (A,Ãï¿½): V ÃÂ£ (A) := Ã¢Ë' Ãï¿½Ã¢ËËÃâº(A) V (A,Ãï¿½). (10) Ãâº(A)=Ã¢Ëâ¦, which happens when Ãï¿½(A) = 0, then we assume that the sum on the right-hand side {0}. The following notations can be seen as the Ã¢â¬ÅglobalÃ¢â¬ï¿½ definition of cyclicity in nonnegative algebra d in max algebra. 1. Let ÃÆ Ãï¿½ be the lcm of all cyclicities of spectral classes associated with Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËË Ãâº + (A) (nonnegative algebra), or the cyclicity of critical graph associated with Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº Ã¢Å â¢ (A) (max algebra). 2. Let ÃÆ Ãâº be the lcm of all ÃÆ Ãï¿½ where Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A). e difference between the definitions of ÃÆ Ãï¿½ in max algebra and in nonnegative algebra comes from e corresponding versions of the PerronÃ¢â¬"Frobenius theory. In particular, let A Ã¢ËË R nÃ-n + be an irre- cible matrix. While in nonnegative algebra the eigencone associated with the Perron root of A is ways reduced to a single ray, the number of (appropriately normalized) extremals of the eigencone A in max algebra is equal to the number of critical components, so that there may be up to n such tremals. One of the key results of the present paper relates the core with the sum of eigencones. The nnegative part of this result can be found in Tam and Schneider [43, Theorem 4.2, part (iii)]. ain Theorem 1. Let A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + .Then core(A)= Ã¢Ë' k 1,Ãï¿½Ã¢ËËÃâº(A) V ( A k ,Ãï¿½ k ) = V ÃÂ£ ( A ÃÆ Ãâº ) . The main part of the proof is given in Section 4, for both algebras simultaneously. However, this oof takes in Ã¢â¬ÅcreditÃ¢â¬ï¿½ some facts, which we will have to show. First of all, we need the equality Ãâº ( A k ) = { Ãï¿½ k : Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A) } . (11) is simple relation between Ãâº(A k ) and Ãâº(A), which can be seen as a special case of [24, Theo- m 3.6(ii)], will be also proved below as Corollary 5.5. To complete the proof of Main Theorem 1 we also have to study the periodic sequence of eigen- nes of matrix powers and their sums. On this way we obtain the following key result, both in max d nonnegative algebra. ain Theorem 2. Let A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + .Then i) ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ,forÃï¿½ Ã¢ËË Ãâº(A), is the period of the sequence {V (A k ,Ãï¿½ k )} k 1 ,andV(A k ,Ãï¿½ k ) Ã¢Å â  V (A ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ,Ãï¿½ ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ) for all k 1; i) ÃÆ Ãâº is the period of the sequence {V ÃÂ£ (A k )} k 1 ,andV ÃÂ£ (A k )Ã¢Å â  V ÃÂ£ (A ÃÆ Ãâº ) for all k 1. Main Theorem 2 is proved in Section 7 as a corollary of Theorems 7.3 and 7.4, where the inclusion lations between eigencones of matrix powers are studied in detail.Theorem 6.5, which gives a detailed description of extremals of both cores, can be also seen as a y result of this paper. However, it is too long to be formulated in advance. 4. 4. m al Le Pr of ni th 4. an gr M eq in {A Th A gr en th A of ofP.

In the main argu- ent, we consider the cases of max algebra and nonnegative algebra simultaneously. One of the most elementary and useful properties of the intersection in (9) is that, actually, span(A)Ã¢Å â¡ span ( A 2 ) Ã¢Å â¡ span ( A 3 ) Ã¢Å â¡ÃÂ·ÃÂ·ÃÂ·. (12) Generalizing an argument of Pullman [33] we will prove that core(A)= Ã¢Ë' k 1 V ÃÂ£ ( A k ) = Ã¢Ë' k 1,Ãï¿½Ã¢ËËÃâº(A) V ( A k ,Ãï¿½ k ) (13) so in max algebra. Note that the following inclusion is almost immediate. mma 4.1. Ã¢Ë' k 1 V ÃÂ£ (A k )Ã¢Å â  core(A). oof. x Ã¢ËË V (A k ,Ãï¿½) implies that A k x= Ãï¿½x and hence x= Ãï¿½ Ã¢Ë't A kt x for all t 1 (using the invertibility multiplication). Hence x Ã¢ËË Ã¢â¹' t 1 span A kt = Ã¢â¹' t 1 span(A t ). So it remains to show the opposite inclusion core(A)Ã¢Å â  Ã¢Ë' k 1 V ÃÂ£ ( A k ) . (14) Let us first treat the trivial case Ãï¿½(A)= 0, i.e., Ãâº(A)=Ã¢Ëâ¦. There are only trivial classes in the Frobe- us normal form, and G(A) is acyclic. This implies A k = 0 for some k 1. In this case core(A)={0}, e sum on the right-hand side is {0} by convention, so (13)isthetrivialÃ¢â¬ÅdrawÃ¢â¬ï¿½{0}={0}. 2. Max algebra: cases of ultimate periodicity In max algebra, unlike the nonnegative algebra, there are wide classes of matrices for which (14) d (13) follow almost immediately. We list some of them below. S 1 : Irreducible matrices. S 2 : Ultimately periodic matrices. This is when the sequence {A Ã¢Å -k } k 1 is ultimately periodic with a owth rate Ãï¿½ (in other words, when the sequence {(A/Ãï¿½) Ã¢Å -k } k 1 is ultimately periodic). As shown by olnÃÂ¡rovÃÂ¡ and PribiÃÂ¡ [30], this happens if and only if the Perron roots of all nontrivial classes of A ual Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A)= Ãï¿½ . S 3 : Robust matrices. For any vector x Ã¢ËËR n + the orbit {A Ã¢Å -k Ã¢Å - x} k 1 hits an eigenvector of A,mean- g that A Ã¢Å -T Ã¢Å - x is an eigenvector of A for some T . This implies that the whole remaining part Ã¢Å -k Ã¢Å - x} k T of the orbit (the Ã¢â¬ÅtailÃ¢â¬ï¿½ of the orbit) consists of multiples of that eigenvector A Ã¢Å -T Ã¢Å - x. e notion of robustness was introduced and studied in [9]. S 4 : Orbit periodic matrices:Foranyvectorx Ã¢ËË R n + the orbit {A Ã¢Å -k Ã¢Å - x} k 1 hits an eigenvector of Ã¢Å -ÃÆ x for some ÃÆ x , implying that the remaining Ã¢â¬ÅtailÃ¢â¬ï¿½ of the orbit {A Ã¢Å -k Ã¢Å - x} k 1 is periodic with some owth rate. See [40, Section 7] for a characterization. S 5 : Column periodic matrices. This is when for all i we have (A Ã¢Å -(t+ÃÆ i ) ) ÃÂ·i = Ãï¿½ ÃÆ i i A Ã¢Å -t ÃÂ·i for all large ough t and some Ãï¿½ i and ÃÆ i . Observe that S 1 Ã¢Å â  S 2 Ã¢Å â  S 4 Ã¢Å â  S 5 and S 3 Ã¢Å â  S 4 .Indeed,S 1 Ã¢Å â  S 2 is the Cyclicity Theorem 2.4.For e inclusion S 2 Ã¢Å â  S 4 observe that, if A is ultimately periodic then A Ã¢Å -(t+ÃÆ) = Ãï¿½ ÃÆ A Ã¢Å -t and hence Ã¢Å -(t+ÃÆ) Ã¢Å - x= Ãï¿½ ÃÆ A Ã¢Å -t Ã¢Å - x holds for all x Ã¢ËËR n and all big enough t . Observe that S 3 is a special case+ S 4 , which is a special case of S 5 since the columns of matrix powers can be considered as orbits the unit vectors. 19 qu im la fic 4. co po at fr of in ra Le z Pr sc Si no fr im Th K K Pr K {y co co al la w to y l40 P. Butkovi cÃâ¡ et al. / Linear Algebra and its Applications 439 (2013) 1929Ã¢â¬"1954 To see that (14) holds in all these cases, note that in the column periodic case all column se- ences {A t ÃÂ·i } t 1 end up with periodically repeating eigenvectors of A Ã¢Å -ÃÆ i or the zero vector, which plies that span Ã¢Å â¢ (A Ã¢Å -t ) Ã¢Å â  Ã¢Å â¢ k 1 V ÃÂ£ Ã¢Å â¢ (A Ã¢Å -k ) Ã¢Å â  core Ã¢Å â¢ (A) and hence span Ã¢Å â¢ (A Ã¢Å -t ) = core Ã¢Å â¢ (A) for all rge enough t.Thus,finite stabilization of the core occurs in all these classes. A necessary and suf- ient condition for this finite stabilization is described in [12]. 3. Core: a general argument The original argument of Pullman [33, Section 2] used the separation of a point from a closed nvex cone by an open homogeneous halfspace (that contains the cone and does not contain the int). In the case of max algebra, Nitica and Singer [32] showed that at each point x Ã¢ËË R n + there are most n maximal max cones not containing this point. These conical semispaces, used to separate x om any max cone not containing x, turn out to be open. Hence they can be used in the max version PullmanÃ¢â¬â¢s argument. However, for the sake of a simultaneous proof we will exploit the following analytic argument stead of separation. By B(x, ) we denote the intersection of the open ball centred at x Ã¢ËË R n + of dius with R n + . In the remaining part of Section 4 we consider both algebras simultaneously. mma 4.2. Let x 1 ,...,x m Ã¢ËË R n + be nonzero and let z /Ã¢ËË span(x 1 ,...,x m ). Then there exists &gt; 0 such that /Ã¢ËË span(B(x 1 , ),...,B(x m , )). oof. By contradiction assume that for each there exist points y i ( ) Ã¢ËË B(x i , ) and nonnegative alars ÃÂµ i ( ) such that z= m Ã¢Ë' i=1 ÃÂµ i ( )y i ( ). (15) nce y i ( )Ã¢â ' x i as Ã¢â ' 0 and x i are nonzero, we can assume that y i ( ) are bounded from below by nzero vectors v i , and then z Ã¢Ë' m i=1 ÃÂµ i ( )v i for all , implying that ÃÂµ i ( ) are uniformly bounded om above. By compactness we can assume that ÃÂµ i ( ) converge to some ÃÂµ i Ã¢ËË R + , and then (15) plies by continuity that z= Ã¢Ë' m i=1 ÃÂµ i x i , a contradiction. eorem 4.3. (See [33, Theorem 2.1].) Assume that {K l } for l 1, is a sequence of cones in R n + such that l+1 Ã¢Å â  K l for all l, and each of them is generated by no more than k nonzero vectors. Then the intersection = Ã¢â¹' Ã¢ËÅ¾ l=1 K l is also generated by no more than k vectors. oof. Let K l = span(y l1 ,...,y lk ) (where some of the vectors y l1 ,...,y lk may be repeated when l is generated by less than k nonzero vectors), and consider the sequences of normalized vectors li /Ã¢â¬-y li Ã¢â¬-} l 1 for i = 1,...,k, where Ã¢â¬-uÃ¢â¬-:=max u i (or any other norm). As the set {u: Ã¢â¬-uÃ¢â¬-=1} is mpact, we can find a subsequence {l t } t 1 such that for i = 1,...,k,thesequence{y l t i /Ã¢â¬-y l t i Ã¢â¬-} t 1 nverges to a finite vector u i , which is nonzero since Ã¢â¬-u i Ã¢â¬-=1. We will assume that Ã¢â¬-y l t i Ã¢â¬-=1for l i and t . We now show that u 1 ,...,u k Ã¢ËË K . Consider any i = 1,...,k.Foreachs, y l t i Ã¢ËË K s for all sufficiently rge t.As{y l t i } t 1 converges to u i and K s is closed, we have u i Ã¢ËË K s . Since this is true for each s, e have u i Ã¢ËË Ã¢â¹' Ã¢ËÅ¾ s=1 K s = K . Thus u 1 ,...,u k Ã¢ËË K , and span(u 1 ,...,u k ) Ã¢Å â  K . We claim that also K Ã¢Å â  span(u 1 ,...,u k ). Assume the contrary that there is z Ã¢ËË K that is not in span(u 1 ,...,u k ). Then by Lemma 4.2 there exists &gt; 0 such that z /Ã¢ËË span(B(u 1 , ),...,B(u k , )).Sincethesequence{y l t i } t 1 converges to u i ,wehave t i Ã¢ËË B(u i , ) for t large enough, andspan ( y l t 1 ,...,y l t k ) Ã¢Å â  span ( B ( u 1 , ) ,...,B ( u k , )) .

Theorem 4.3 applies to the sequence {span(A t )} t 1 , so core(A) is generated by no more than n ctors. oposition 4.4. (See [33, Lemma 2.3].) The mapping induced by A on its core is a surjection. oof. First note that A does induce a mapping on its core. If z Ã¢ËË core(A) then for each t there exists vectorx t such that z= A t x t .HenceAz= A t+1 x t ,soAzÃ¢ËË Ã¢â¹' t 2 span A t = core(A). Next, let m be such that A m has the greatest number of zero columns (we assume that A is t nilpotent; recall that a zero column in A k remains zero in all subsequent powers). If z = A t x t r t m + 1, we also can represent it as A m+1 u t , where u t := A tÃ¢Ë'mÃ¢Ë'1 x t . The components of u t rresponding to the nonzero columns of A m+1 are bounded since A m+1 u t = z. So we can assume that esequenceofsubvectorsofu t with these components converges. Then the sequence y t := A m u t so converges, since the indices of nonzero columns of A m coincide with those of A m+1 , which are e indices of the converging subvectors of u t .Lety be the limit of y t .Sincey s = A sÃ¢Ë'1 x s are in an(A t ) for all s&gt; t , and since span(A t ) are closed, we obtain y Ã¢ËË span(A t ) for all t . Thus we found Ã¢ËË core(A) satisfying Ay= z. Theorem 4.3 and Proposition 4.4 show that the core is generated by finitely many vectors in R n + d that the mapping induced by A on its core is Ã¢â¬ÅontoÃ¢â¬ï¿½. Now we use the fact that a finitely generated cone in the nonnegative orthant (and more generally, osed cone) is generated by its extremals both in nonnegative algebra and in max algebra, see [10, ]. oposition 4.5. (See [33, Theorem 2.2].) The mapping induced by A on the extremal generators of its core is permutation(i.e., a bijection). oof. Let core(A)= span(u 1 ,...,u k ) where u 1 ,...,u k are extremals of the core. Suppose that x j is a eimage of u j in the core, that is, Ax j = u j for some x j Ã¢ËË core(A), j = 1,...,k.Thenx j = Ã¢Ë' k i=1 ÃÂ± i u i r some nonnegative coefficients ÃÂ± 1 ,...,ÃÂ± k , and u j = Ã¢Ë' k i=1 ÃÂ± i Au i .Sinceu j is extremal, it follows at u j is proportional to Au i for some i.Thusforeach j Ã¢ËË{1,...,k} there exists an i Ã¢ËË{1,...,k} ch that Au i is a positive multiple of u j .Butsinceforeachi Ã¢ËË{1,...,k} there is at most one j ch that Au i is a positive multiple of u j , it follows that A induces a bijection on the set of extremal nerators of its core. We are now ready to prove (13) and Main Theorem 1 taking the periodicity of the eigencone quence (Main Theorem 2)inÃ¢â¬ÅcreditÃ¢â¬ï¿½. oof of Main Theorem 1. Proposition 4.5 implies that all extremals of core(A) are eigenvectors of A q , here q denotes the order of the permutation induced by A on the extremals of core(A).Hence re(A) is a subcone of the sum of all eigencones of all powers of A, which is the inclusion rela- n (14). Combining this with the reverse inclusion of Lemma 4.1 we obtain that core(A) is precisely e sum of all eigencones of all powers of A, and using (11) (proved in Section 5 below), we obtain e first part of the equality of Main Theorem 1. The last part of the equality of Main Theorem 1 now llows from the periodicity of eigencones formulated in Main Theorem 2, or more precisely, from the eaker result of Theorem 7.1 proved in Section 7. Spectral classes and critical components of matrix powersThis section is rather of technical importance. It shows that the union of node sets of all spectral asses is invariant under matrix powering, and that access relations between spectral classes in all 19 m to th 5. fa sp no co an ou Le le ( (i (i Pr V su a he fo th on Le al Pr as pr It gc it 8 ei ce pa th Ã¢â¬ÅT ca42 P.

Further, the case of an arbitrary eigenvalue can be reduced the case of the principal eigenvalue for all powers simultaneously (in both algebras). At the end of e section we consider the critical components of max-algebraic powers. 1. Classes and access relations As in Section 4, the arguments are presented in both algebras simultaneously. This is due to the ctthattheedgesetsofG(A Ã¢Å -k ) and G(A Ã-k ) are the same for any k and that the definitions of ectral classes in both algebras are alike. Results of this section can be traced back, for the case of nnegative algebra, to the classical work of Frobenius [18], see remarks on the very first page of [18] ncerning the powers of an irreducible nonnegative matrix. 8 The reader is also referred to the monographs of Minc [29], Berman and Plemmons [3], Brualdi d Ryser [5], and we will often cite the work of Tam and Schneider [43, Section 4] containing all of r results in this section, in nonnegative algebra. mma 5.1. (Cf. [3, Chapter 5, Ex. 6.9], [43, Lemma 4.5].) Let A be irreducible with the unique eigenvalue Ãï¿½ , t G(A) have cyclicity ÃÆ and k be a positive integer. i) A k is permutationally similar to a direct sum of gcd(k, ÃÆ ) irreducible blocks with eigenvalues Ãï¿½ k ,andA k does not have eigenvalues other than Ãï¿½ k . i) If k is a multiple of ÃÆ , then the sets of indices in these blocks coincide with the cyclic classes of G(A). ii) If supp(x) is a cyclic class of G(A),thensupp(Ax) is the previous cyclic class. oof. (i) Assuming without loss of generality Ãï¿½ = 1, let X = diag(x) for a positive eigenvector x Ã¢ËË (A,Ãï¿½) and consider B := X Ã¢Ë'1 AX which is stochastic (nonnegative algebra), or max-stochastic, i.e., ch that Ã¢Å â¢ n j=1 b ij =1holdsforalli (max algebra). By Theorem 2.1, B k is permutationally similar to direct sum of gcd(k, ÃÆ ) irreducible isolated blocks. These blocks are stochastic (or max-stochastic), nce they all have an eigenvector (1,...,1) associated with the unique eigenvalue 1. If x Ã¢ËË V (A k , Ãï¿½ÃÅ) r some Ãï¿½ÃÅ , then its subvectors corresponding to the irreducible blocks of A k are also eigenvectors of ose blocks, or zero vectors. Hence Ãï¿½ÃÅ = 1, which is the only eigenvalue of A k . (ii) By Theorem 2.1, G(A) splits into gcd(k, ÃÆ )= ÃÆ components, and each of them contains exactly e cyclic class of G(A). (iii) Use the definition of cyclic classes and that each node has an ingoing edge. mma 5.2. Both in max algebra and in nonnegative linear algebra, the trivial classes of A k are the same for l k. oof. In both algebras, an index belongs to a class with nonzero Perron root if and only if the sociated graph contains a cycle with a nonzero weight traversing the node with that index. This operty is invariant under taking matrix powers, hence the claim. In both algebras, each class ÃÂµ of A with cyclicity ÃÆ corresponds to an irreducible submatrix A ÃÂµÃÂµ . is easy to see that (A k ) ÃÂµÃÂµ = (A ÃÂµÃÂµ ) k . Applying Lemma 5.1 to A ÃÂµÃÂµ we see that ÃÂµ gives rise to d(k, ÃÆ ) classes in A k , which are said to be derived from their common ancestor ÃÂµ.IfÃÂµ is trivial, then gives rise to a unique trivial derived class of A k , and if ÃÂµ is nontrivial then all the derived classes Frobenius defines (what we could call) the cyclicity or index of imprimitivity k of an irreducible S as the number of genvalues that lie on the spectral circle. He then remarks Ã¢â¬ÅIf A is primitive, then every power of A is again primitive and a rtain power and all subsequent powers are positiveÃ¢â¬ï¿½. This is followed by Ã¢â¬ÅIf A is imprimitive, then A m consists of d irreducible rts where d is the greatest common divisor of m and k.Further,A m is completely reducible. The characteristic functions ofe components differ only in the powers of the variableÃ¢â¬ï¿½ (which provides a converse to the preceding assertion). And then he matrix A k is the lowest power of A whose components are all primitiveÃ¢â¬ï¿½.

Note that this is an equivalence relation on the set of classes of all powers of A. Evidently, classofA k isderivedfromaclassofA if and only if its index set is contained in the index set of e latter class. It is also clear that each class of A k has an ancestor in A. We now observe that access relations in matrix powers are Ã¢â¬Åessentially the sameÃ¢â¬ï¿½. This has iden- al proof in max algebra and nonnegative algebra. mma 5.3. Let A Ã¢ËË R nÃ-n + . For all k, l 1 and Ãï¿½ &gt; 0,ifanindexiÃ¢ËË{1,...,n} accesses (resp. is accessed by) classwithPerronrootÃï¿½ k in A k then i accesses (resp. is accessed by) a related class with Perron root Ãï¿½ l in A l . oof. We deduce from Lemma 5.1 and Lemma 5.2 that the index set of each class of A k with Perron ot Ãï¿½ k is contained in the ancestor class of A with Perron root Ãï¿½ . Then, i accessing (resp. being cessed by) a class in A k implies i accessing (resp. being accessed by) its ancestor in A.SinceÃï¿½ &gt; 0, is ancestor class is nontrivial, so the access path can be extended to have a length divisible by l,by eans of a path contained in the ancestor class. By Lemma 5.1, the ancestor decomposes in A l into veral classes with the common Perron root Ãï¿½ l , and i accesses (resp. is accessed by) one of them. eorem 5.4. (See [43, Corollary 4.6].) Let A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + . i) If a class ÃÂµ is spectral in A, then so are the classes derived from it in A k . Conversely, each spectral class of A k is derived from a spectral class of A. i) For each class ÃÂµ of A with cyclicity ÃÆ , there are gcd(k, ÃÆ ) classes of A k derived from it. If k is a multiple of ÃÆ then the index sets of derived classes are the cyclic classes of ÃÂµ. oof. (i) We will prove the following equivalent statement: For each pair ÃÂµ,ÃÂ½ where ÃÂµ is a class A and ÃÂ½ is a class derived from ÃÂµ in A k , we have that ÃÂµ is non-spectral if and only if ÃÂ½ is n-spectral. Observe that by Lemma 5.2, the Perron root of ÃÂµ is 0 if and only if the Perron root of ÃÂ½ is 0. In is case, both ÃÂµ and ÃÂ½ are non-spectral (by definition). Further, let Ãï¿½ &gt; 0 be the Perron root of ÃÂµ. en, by Lemma 5.1, the Perron root of ÃÂ½ is Ãï¿½ k .Leti be an index in ÃÂ½.ItalsobelongstoÃÂµ. If ÃÂµ is non-spectral, then i is accessed in A by a class with Perron root Ãï¿½ Ã¢â¬Â² such that Ãï¿½ Ã¢â¬Â² &gt; Ãï¿½ in max gebra, resp. Ãï¿½ Ã¢â¬Â² Ãï¿½ in nonnegative algebra. By Lemma 5.3,thereisaclassofA k , which accesses in A k and has Perron root (Ãï¿½ Ã¢â¬Â² ) k .Sincewehave(Ãï¿½ Ã¢â¬Â² ) k &gt; Ãï¿½ k in max algebra or resp. (Ãï¿½ Ã¢â¬Â² ) k Ãï¿½ k in nnegative algebra, we obtain that ÃÂ½ , being the class to which i belongs in A k , is also non-spectral. Conversely, if ÃÂ½ is non-spectral, then i is accessed in A k by a class ÃÂ¸ with Perron root equal to Ãï¿½ÃÅ k r some Ãï¿½ÃÅ , and such that Ãï¿½ÃÅ k &gt;Ãï¿½ k in max algebra, resp. Ãï¿½ÃÅ k Ãï¿½ k in nonnegative algebra. The ancestor ÃÂ¸ in A accesses 9 i in A and has Perron root Ãï¿½ÃÅ.SincewehaveÃï¿½ÃÅ &gt; Ãï¿½ in max algebra or resp. Ãï¿½ÃÅ Ãï¿½ nonnegative algebra, we obtain that ÃÂµ, being the class to which i belongs in A, is also non-spectral. rt (i) is proved. (ii) This part follows directly from Lemma 5.1 parts (i) and (ii). rollary 5.5. Let A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + and k 1.ThenÃâº(A k )={Ãï¿½ k : Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A)}. oof. By Theorem 2.10, the nonzero eigenvalues of A (resp. A k ) are precisely the Perron roots of e spectral classes of A (resp. A k ). By Theorem 5.4(i), if a class of A is spectral, then so is any class rived from it in A k . This implies that Ãâº(A k )Ã¢Å â¡{Ãï¿½ k : Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A)}. The converse inclusion follows from e converse part of Theorem 5.4(i). Let us note yet another corollary of Theorem 5.4.ForA Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + and Ãï¿½ 0, let N(A,Ãï¿½) be the union index sets of all classes of A with Perron root Ãï¿½ , and N s (A,Ãï¿½) be the union of index sets of allThis can be observed immediately, or obtained by applying Lemma 5.3. 19 sp ar Co ( (i Pr fr pa th ca no Th ( (i (i Pr Pr w By 5. cy fo Le of se an Th (44 P.

(ii) Inclusion N s (A,Ãï¿½) Ã¢Å â  N s (A k ,Ãï¿½ k ) follows om the direct part of Theorem 5.4(i), and inclusion N s (A k ,Ãï¿½ k )Ã¢Å â  N s (A,Ãï¿½) follows from the converse rt of Theorem 5.4(i). For the eigencones of A Ã¢ËË R nÃ-n + , the case of an arbitrary Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A) can be reduced to the case of e principal eigenvalue: V (A,Ãï¿½)= V (A Ãï¿½ ,1) (Proposition 2.11). Now we extend this reduction to the se of V (A k ,Ãï¿½ k ),foranyk 1. As in the case of Proposition 2.11, we assume that A is in Frobenius rmal form. eorem 5.7. Let k 1 and Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A). i) The set of all indices having access to the spectral classes of A k with the eigenvalue Ãï¿½ k equals M Ãï¿½ ,for each k. i) (A k ) M Ãï¿½ M Ãï¿½ = Ãï¿½ k (A Ãï¿½ ) k M Ãï¿½ M Ãï¿½ . ii) V (A k ,Ãï¿½ k )= V ((A Ãï¿½ ) k ,1). oof. (i) Apply Corollary 5.6 part (ii) and Lemma 5.3. (ii) Use that M Ãï¿½ is initial in G(A). (iii) By oposition 2.11 we have (assuming that A k is in Frobenius normal form) that V (A k ,Ãï¿½ k )= V (A k Ãï¿½ k ,1) here, instead of (8), A k Ãï¿½ k := Ãï¿½ Ã¢Ë'k ( 00 0 A k M k Ãï¿½ M k Ãï¿½ ) , and M k Ãï¿½ := { i: iÃ¢â ' ÃÂ½, ÃÂ½ is ( A k ,Ãï¿½ k ) -spectral } . (16) part (i) M k Ãï¿½ = M Ãï¿½ ,henceA k Ãï¿½ k = (A Ãï¿½ ) k and the claim follows. 2. Critical components In max algebra, when A is assumed to be strictly visualized, each component ÃÂµÃÅ of C(A) with clicity ÃÆ corresponds to an irreducible submatrix A [1] ÃÂµÃÅÃÂµÃÅ (as in the case of classes, A ÃÂµÃÅÃÂµÃÅ is a shorthand r A N ÃÂµÃÅ N ÃÂµÃÅ ). Using the strict visualization and Lemma 2.8 we see that (A Ã¢Å -k ) [1] ÃÂµÃÅÃÂµÃÅ = (A [1] ÃÂµÃÅÃÂµÃÅ ) Ã¢Å -k . Applying mma 5.1(i) to A [1] ÃÂµÃÅÃÂµÃÅ we see that ÃÂµÃÅ gives rise to gcd(k, ÃÆ ) critical components in A Ã¢Å -k .Asinthecase classes, these components are said to be derived from their common ancestor ÃÂµÃÅ. Evidently a component of C(A Ã¢Å -k ) is derived from a component of C(A) if and only if its index t is contained in the index set of the latter component. Following this line we now formulate an alogue of Theorem 5.4 (and some other results). eorem 5.8. (Cf. [7, Theorem 8.2.6], [8, Theorem 2.3].) Let A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + . i) For each component ÃÂµÃÅ of C(A) with cyclicity ÃÆ , there are gcd(k, ÃÆ ) components of C(A Ã¢Å -k ) derived fromit. Conversely, each component of C(A Ã¢Å -k ) is derived from a component of C(A).IfkisamultipleofÃÆ , then index sets in the derived components are the cyclic classes of ÃÂµÃÅ.

(i), (ii) Both statements are based on the fact that C(A Ã¢Å -k )= (C(A)) k , shown in Lemma 2.8.To tain (i), also apply Theorem 2.1 to a component ÃÂµÃÅ of C(A). (iii) Use (A Ã¢Å - x) [1] = A [1] Ã¢Å - x [1] ,the finition of cyclic classes and the fact that each node in ÃÂµÃÅ has an ingoing edge. Describing extremals The aim of this section is to describe the extremals of the core, in both algebras. To this end, we st give a parallel description of extremals of eigencones (the FrobeniusÃ¢â¬"Victory theorems). 1. Extremals of the eigencones We now describe the principal eigencones in nonnegative linear algebra and then in max algebra. means of Proposition 2.11, this description can be obviously extended to the general case. As in ction 2.6, both descriptions are essentially known: see [7,18,19,35]. We emphasize that the vectors x (ÃÂµ) and x (ÃÂµÃÅ) appearing below are full-size. eorem 6.1 (FrobeniusÃ¢â¬"Victory). (See [35, Theorem 3.7].) Let A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + have Ãï¿½ + (A)= 1. i) Each spectral classÃÂµwith Ãï¿½ + ÃÂµ = 1 corresponds to an eigenvector x (ÃÂµ) , whose support consists of all indices in the classes that have access to ÃÂµ,andallvectorsxofV + (A,1) with supp x= supp x (ÃÂµ) are multiples of x (ÃÂµ) . i) V + (A,1) is generated by x (ÃÂµ) of (i),forÃÂµ ranging over all spectral classes with Ãï¿½ + ÃÂµ = 1. i) x (ÃÂµ) of (i) are extremals of V + (A,1). (Moreover, x (ÃÂµ) are linearly independent.) Note that the extremality and the usual linear independence of x (ÃÂµ) (involving linear combinations ith possibly negative coefficients) can be deduced from the description of supports in part (i), and om the fact that in nonnegative algebra, spectral classes associated with the same Ãï¿½ do not access ch other. This linear independence also means that V + (A,1) is a simplicial cone. See also [35, eorem 4.1]. eorem 6.2. (See [7, Theorem 4.3.5], [41, Theorem 2.8].) Let A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + have Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A)= 1. i) Each component ÃÂµÃÅ of C(A) corresponds to an eigenvector x (ÃÂµÃÅ) defined as one of the columns A Ã¢Ë- ÃÂ·i with i Ã¢ËË N ÃÂµÃÅ , all such columns with i Ã¢ËË N ÃÂµÃÅ being multiples of each other. Ã¢â¬Â² ) Each component ÃÂµÃÅ of C(A) is contained in a (spectral) class ÃÂµ with Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ ÃÂµ = 1, and the support of each x (ÃÂµÃÅ) of (i) consists of all indices in the classes that have access to ÃÂµ. i) V Ã¢Å â¢ (A,1) is generated by x (ÃÂµÃÅ) of (i),forÃÂµÃÅ ranging over all components of C(A). i) x (ÃÂµÃÅ) of (i) are extremals in V Ã¢Å â¢ (A,1). (Moreover, x (ÃÂµÃÅ) are strongly linearly independent in the sense of [6].) To verify (i Ã¢â¬Â² ), not explicitly stated in the references, use (i) and the path interpretation of A Ã¢Ë- . Vectors x (ÃÂµÃÅ) of Theorem 6.2 are also called the fundamental eigenvectors of A, in max algebra. Ap- ying a strict visualization scaling (Theorem 2.7) allows us to get further details on these fundamental genvectors. oposition 6.3. (See [41, Proposition 4.1].) Let A Ã¢ËË R nÃ-n + be strictly visualized (in particular, Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ (A) = 1). en i) For each component ÃÂµÃÅ of C(A),x (ÃÂµÃÅ) of Theorem 6.2 can be canonically chosen as A Ã¢Ë- ÃÂ·i for any i Ã¢ËË N ÃÂµÃÅ ,allcolumns with i Ã¢ËË N ÃÂµÃÅ being equal to each other. i) x (ÃÂµÃÅ) i 1 for all i. Moreover, supp(x (ÃÂµÃÅ)[1] )= N ÃÂµÃÅ . 19 6. Pr V Pr k Ãï¿½ Ãï¿½ x va So w th ci ex Th ( (i (i (i Pr In ÃÆ in an su al he pr di su46 P.

For each k 1, the set of extremals of V ÃÂ£ (A k ) is the union of the sets of extremals of (A k ,Ãï¿½ k ) for Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A). oof. Due to the fact that Ãâº(A k )={Ãï¿½ k : Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A)}, we can assume without loss of generality that = 1. 1. As V ÃÂ£ (A) is the sum of V (A,Ãï¿½) for Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A), it is generated by the extremals of V (A,Ãï¿½) for Ã¢ËËÃâº(A). Hence each extremal of V ÃÂ£ (A) is an extremal of V (A,Ãï¿½) for some Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A). 2. Let x Ã¢ËË V (A,Ãï¿½ ÃÂµ ), for some spectral class ÃÂµ, be extremal. Assume without loss of generality that ÃÂµ = 1, and by contradiction that there exist vectors y ÃÂº , all of them extremals of V ÃÂ£ (A), such that = Ã¢Ë' ÃÂº y ÃÂº . By above, all vectors y ÃÂº are eigenvectors of A.Ifthereisy ÃÂº associated with an eigen- lue Ãï¿½ ÃÂ½ &gt; 1, then applying A t we obtain x = (Ãï¿½ ÃÂ½ ) t y ÃÂº +ÃÂ·ÃÂ·ÃÂ·, which is impossible at large enough t . Ãï¿½ ÃÂ½ 1. With this in mind, if there is y ÃÂº associated with Ãï¿½ ÃÂ½ &lt; 1, then: 1) in nonnegative algebra e obtain Ax&gt; A Ã¢Ë' ÃÂº y ÃÂº , a contradiction; 2) in max algebra, all nonzero entries of A Ã¢Å - y ÃÂº go below e corresponding entries of x meaning that y ÃÂº is redundant. Thus we are left only with y ÃÂº asso- ated with Ãï¿½ Ã¢Å â¢ ÃÂ½ = 1, which is a contradiction: an extremal x Ã¢ËË V Ã¢Å â¢ (A,1) appearsasaÃ¢â¬ÅsumÃ¢â¬ï¿½ofother tremals of V Ã¢Å â¢ (A,1) not proportional to x. Avectorx Ã¢ËËR n + is called normalized if max x i = 1. Recall the notation ÃÆ Ãâº introduced in Section 3. eorem 6.5. (Cf. [43, Theorem 4.7].) Let A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + and ÃÆ := ÃÆ Ãâº . i) The set of extremals of core(A) is the union of the sets of extremals of V (A ÃÆ ,Ãï¿½ ÃÆ ) for all Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A). i) In nonnegative algebra,eachspectralclassÃÂµ with cyclicity ÃÆ ÃÂµ corresponds to a set of distinct ÃÆ ÃÂµ normalized extremals of core + (A), such that there exists an index in their support that belongs to ÃÂµ,and each index in their support has access to ÃÂµ. In max algebra, each critical component ÃÂµÃÅ with cyclicity ÃÆ ÃÂµÃÅ associated with some Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËË Ãâº Ã¢Å â¢ (A) corre- sponds to a set of distinct ÃÆ ÃÂµÃÅ normalized extremals x of core Ã¢Å â¢ (A), which are (normalized) columns of (A ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ) Ã¢Ë- with indices in N ÃÂµÃÅ . ii) Each set of extremals described in (ii) forms a simple cycle under the action of A. v) There are no normalized extremals other than those described in (ii). In nonnegative algebra,thetotal number of normalized extremals equals the sum of cyclicities of all spectral classes of A. In max algebra, the total number of normalized extremals equals the sum of cyclicities of all critical components of A. oof. (i) follows from Main Theorem 1 and Proposition 6.4. For the proof of (ii) and (iii) we can fix Ãï¿½ = Ãï¿½ ÃÂµ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A) and assume A = A Ãï¿½ (using Theorem 5.7). max algebra, we also assume that A is strictly visualized. (ii) In nonnegative algebra, observe that by Theorem 5.4,eachspectralclassÃÂµ of A gives rise to ÃÂµ spectral classes in A Ã-ÃÆ , whose node sets are cyclic classes of ÃÂµ (note that ÃÆ ÃÂµ divides ÃÆ ). Accord- g to FrobeniusÃ¢â¬"Victory Theorem 6.1, these classes give rise to normalized extremals of V + (A Ã-ÃÆ ,1), d the conditions on support follow from Theorem 6.1 and Lemma 5.3. (iii) Let x be an extremal described above. Then supp(x) Ã¢ËÂ© N ÃÂµ is a cyclic class of ÃÂµ and pp(Ax) Ã¢ËÂ© N ÃÂµ is the previous cyclic class of ÃÂµ, by Lemma 5.1 part (iii). It can be checked that l indices in supp(Ax) also have access to ÃÂµ.ByProposition4.5, Ax is an extremal of core + (A), and nce an extremal of V + (A Ã-ÃÆ ,1).Theorem6.1 identifies Ax with the extremal associated with the evious cyclic class of ÃÂµ. Vectors x, Ax,...,A Ã-ÃÆ ÃÂµ Ã¢Ë'1 x are distinct since the intersections of their supports with N ÃÂµ aresjoint, so they are exactly the set of extremals associated with ÃÂµ. Note that A Ã-ÃÆ ÃÂµ x = x,as pp(A Ã-ÃÆ ÃÂµ x)Ã¢ËÂ© N ÃÂµ = supp(x)Ã¢ËÂ© N ÃÂµ , and both vectors are extremals of V + (A Ã-ÃÆ ,1). co co ar (A cy si id (A A of th pa fr in 7.

Butkovi cÃâ¡ et al. / Linear Algebra and its Applications 439 (2013) 1929Ã¢â¬"1954 1947 (ii) In max algebra, observe that by Theorem 5.8(i) each component ÃÂµÃÅ of C(A) gives rise to ÃÆ ÃÂµÃÅ mponents of C(A Ã¢Å -ÃÆ ), whose node sets are the cyclic classes of ÃÂµÃÅ (note that ÃÆ ÃÂµÃÅ divides ÃÆ ). These mponents correspond to ÃÆ ÃÂµÃÅ columns of (A Ã¢Å -ÃÆ ) Ã¢Ë- with indices in different cyclic classes of ÃÂµÃÅ, which e by Theorem 5.8(i) the node sets of components of C(A Ã¢Å -ÃÆ ).ByTheorem6.2 these columns of Ã¢Å -ÃÆ ) Ã¢Ë- are extremals of V Ã¢Å â¢ (A Ã¢Å -ÃÆ ,1), and Proposition 6.3(ii) implies that they are normalized. (iii) Let x be an extremal described above. By Proposition 6.3 and Theorem 5.8(i) supp(x [1] ) is a clic class of ÃÂµÃÅ, and by Theorem 5.8(iii) supp((A Ã¢Å - x) [1] ) is the previous cyclic class of ÃÂµÃÅ.ByPropo- tion 4.5, A Ã¢Å - x is an extremal of core Ã¢Å â¢ (A), and hence an extremal of V Ã¢Å â¢ (A Ã¢Å -ÃÆ ,1).Proposition6.3 entifies A Ã¢Å - x with the extremal associated with the previous cyclic class of ÃÂµÃÅ. Vectors x, A Ã¢Å - x,...,A Ã¢Å -ÃÆ ÃÂµÃÅ Ã¢Ë'1 x are distinct since their booleanizations x [1] , (A Ã¢Å - x) [1] ,..., Ã¢Å -ÃÆ ÃÂµÃÅ Ã¢Ë'1 Ã¢Å - x) [1] are distinct, so they are exactly the set of extremals associated with ÃÂµÃÅ. Note that Ã¢Å -ÃÆ ÃÂµÃÅ Ã¢Å - x= x,as(A Ã¢Å -ÃÆ ÃÂµÃÅ Ã¢Å - x) [1] = x [1] and both vectors are extremals of V Ã¢Å â¢ (A Ã¢Å -ÃÆ ,1). (iv) In both algebras, the converse part of Theorem 5.4(i) shows that there are no spectral classes A ÃÆ other than the ones derived from the spectral classes of A. In nonnegative algebra, this shows at there are no extremals other than described in (ii). In max algebra, on top of that, the converse rt of Theorem 5.8(i) shows that there are no components of C(A Ã¢Å -ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ) other than the ones derived om the components C(A Ãï¿½ ),forÃï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº Ã¢Å â¢ (A), hence there are no extremals other than those described (ii). In both algebras, it remains to count the extremals described in (ii). Sequence of eigencones The main aim of this section is to investigate the periodicity of eigencones and to prove Main eorem 2. Unlike in Section 4, the proof of periodicity will be different for the cases of max algebra d nonnegative algebra. The periods of eigencone sequences in max algebra and in nonnegative ear algebra are also in general different, for the same nonnegative matrix (see Section 8 for an ample). To this end, recall the definitions of ÃÆ Ãï¿½ and ÃÆ Ãâº given in Section 3, which will be used low. 1. Periodicity of the sequence We first observe that in both algebras k divides l Ã¢â¡' V ( A k ,Ãï¿½ k ) Ã¢Å â  V ( A l ,Ãï¿½ l ) Ã¢Ëâ¬Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A), k divides l Ã¢â¡' V ÃÂ£ ( A k ) Ã¢Å â  V ÃÂ£ ( A l ) . (17) We now prove that the sequence of eigencones is periodic. eorem 7.1. Let A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + and Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A). i) V (A k ,Ãï¿½ k )= V (A k+ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ,Ãï¿½ k+ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ),andV(A k ,Ãï¿½ k )Ã¢Å â  V (A ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ,Ãï¿½ ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ) for all k 1. i) V ÃÂ£ (A k )= V ÃÂ£ (A k+ÃÆ Ãâº ) and V ÃÂ£ (A k )Ã¢Å â  V ÃÂ£ (A ÃÆ Ãâº ) for all k 1. oof. We will give two separate proofs of part (i), for the case of max algebra and the case of nnegative algebra. Part (ii) follows from part (i). In both algebras, we can assume without loss of generality that Ãï¿½ = 1, and using Theorem 5.7, that is is the greatest eigenvalue of A. In max algebra,byTheorem2.5, columns of A Ã¢Å -r with indices in N c (A) are periodic for r T c (A). call that by Corollary 2.9, T c (A) is not less than T (C(A)), which is the greatest periodicity threshold the strongly connected components of C(A).ByTheorem2.3 part (ii), (C(A)) tÃÆ consists of complete aphs for tÃÆ T (C(A)), in particular, it contains loops (i, i) for all i Ã¢ËË N c (A).Hencea Ã¢Å -(tÃÆ ) ii = 1 Ã¢Ëâ¬i Ã¢ËË N c (A), t Ã¢ÅË T c (A) ÃÆ Ã¢Åâ° , 19 an or M A O fo im th V by ob Ãï¿½ Pe A th x ( to di go y bi V an by ti V48 P.

Hence we obtain ( A Ã¢Å -(l+tÃÆ ) ) Ã¢Ë- ÃÂ·i ( A Ã¢Å -l ) Ã¢Ë- ÃÂ·i Ã¢Ëâ¬i Ã¢ËË N c (A), Ã¢Ëâ¬l, Ã¢Ëâ¬t Ã¢ÅË T c (A) ÃÆ Ã¢Åâ° . (18) n the other hand, using the ultimate periodicity of critical columns we have ( A Ã¢Å -(l+tÃÆ ) ) Ã¢Ë- ÃÂ·i = Ã¢Å â¢ { A Ã¢Å -s ÃÂ·i : sÃ¢â°Â¡ kl(mod ÃÆ), k 1, s T c (A) } r all l and all tÃÆ T c (A), while generally ( A Ã¢Å -l ) Ã¢Ë- ÃÂ·i Ã¢Å â¢ { A Ã¢Å -s ÃÂ·i : sÃ¢â°Â¡ kl(mod ÃÆ), k 1, s T c (A) } Ã¢Ëâ¬l, plying the reverse inequality with respect to (18). It follows that ( A Ã¢Å -(l+tÃÆ ) ) Ã¢Ë- ÃÂ·i = ( A Ã¢Å -l ) Ã¢Ë- ÃÂ·i Ã¢Ëâ¬i Ã¢ËË N c (A), Ã¢Ëâ¬l, Ã¢Ëâ¬t Ã¢ÅË T c (A) ÃÆ Ã¢Åâ° , (19) erefore (A Ã¢Å -(l+ÃÆ) ) Ã¢Ë- ÃÂ·i = (A Ã¢Å -(l+tÃÆ+ÃÆ) ) Ã¢Ë- ÃÂ·i = (A Ã¢Å -(l+tÃÆ) ) Ã¢Ë- ÃÂ·i = (A Ã¢Å -l ) Ã¢Ë- ÃÂ·i for all critical indices i and all l.Since (A Ã¢Å -l ,1) is generated by the critical columns of (A Ã¢Å -l ) Ã¢Ë- , and the critical indices of A Ã¢Å -l are N c (A) Theorem 5.8(ii), the periodicity V Ã¢Å â¢ (A Ã¢Å -l ,Ãï¿½ l )= V Ã¢Å â¢ (A Ã¢Å -(l+ÃÆ) ,Ãï¿½ l+ÃÆ ) follows. Using this and (17)we tain V Ã¢Å â¢ (A Ã¢Å -l ,Ãï¿½ l )Ã¢Å â  V Ã¢Å â¢ (A Ã¢Å -(lÃÆ) ,Ãï¿½ lÃÆ )= V Ã¢Å â¢ (A Ã¢Å -ÃÆ ,Ãï¿½ ÃÆ ) for each l and Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº Ã¢Å â¢ (A). In nonnegative algebra, also assume that all final classes (and hence only them) have Perron root = 1. Final classes of A Ã-l are derived from the final classes of A; they (and no other classes) have rron root 1. By Theorem 5.4(i) and Corollary 2.2,foranyt 0, the spectral classes of A Ã-l and Ã-(l+tÃÆ) with Perron root 1 have the same sets of nodes, which we denote by N 1 ,...,N m (assuming at their number is m 1). By the FrobeniusÃ¢â¬"Victory Theorem 6.1, the cone V + (A Ã-l ,1) is generated by m extremals 1) ,...,x (m) with the support condition of Theorem 6.1(i) from which we infer that the subvec- rs x (ÃÂµ) ÃÂµ (i.e., x (ÃÂµ) N ÃÂµ ) are positive, while x (ÃÂµ) ÃÂ½ (i.e., x (ÃÂµ) N ÃÂ½ ) are zero for all ÃÂµ = ÃÂ½ from 1 to m,sincethe fferent spectral classes by (6) do not access each other, in the nonnegative linear algebra. Analo- usly the cone V + (A Ã-(l+tÃÆ) ,1) is generated by m eigenvectors y (1) ,...,y (m) such that the subvectors (ÃÂµ) ÃÂµ are positive, while y (ÃÂµ) ÃÂ½ =0forallÃÂµ = ÃÂ½ from 1 to m. Assume first that l = ÃÆ.AsV + (A Ã-ÃÆ ,1) Ã¢Å â  V + (A Ã-(tÃÆ) ,1),eachx (ÃÂµ) is a nonnegative linear com- nation of y (1) ,...,y (m) , and this implies x (ÃÂµ) = y (ÃÂµ) for all ÃÂµ = 1,...,m.HenceV + (A Ã-(tÃÆ) ,1) = + (A Ã-ÃÆ ,1) for all t 0. We also obtain V + (A Ã-l ,1)Ã¢Å â  V + (A Ã-(ÃÆ l) ,1)= V + (A Ã-ÃÆ ,1) for all l.ThusV + (A Ã-l ,1)Ã¢Å â  V + (A Ã-(tÃÆ) ,1), d therefore V + (A Ã-l ,1) Ã¢Å â  V + (A Ã-(l+tÃÆ) ,1).NowifV + (A Ã-l ,1),resp.V + (A Ã-(l+tÃÆ) ,1) are generated x (1) ,...,x (m) ,resp.y (1) ,...,y (m) described above, then each x (ÃÂµ) is a nonnegative linear combina-on of y (1) ,...,y (m) , and this again implies x (ÃÂµ) = y (ÃÂµ) for all ÃÂµ = 1,...,m, and V + (A Ã-(l+tÃÆ) ,1) = + (A Ã-l ,1) for all t 0 and all l.

Inclusion and divisibility We now show that the inclusion relations between the eigencones of different powers of a matrix, both algebras, strictly follow divisibility of exponents of matrix powers with respect to ÃÆ Ãï¿½ and ÃÆ Ãâº . e start with a corollary of Theorem 7.1. mma 7.2. Let k, l 1 and Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A). i) V (A k ,Ãï¿½ k )= V (A gcd(ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ,k) , Ãï¿½ gcd(ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ,k) ) and V ÃÂ£ (A k )= V ÃÂ£ (A gcd(ÃÆ Ãâº ,k) ). i) gcd(k, ÃÆ Ãï¿½ )= gcd(l, ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ) implies V (A k ,Ãï¿½ k )= V (A l ,Ãï¿½ l ),andgcd(k, ÃÆ Ãâº )= gcd(l, ÃÆ Ãâº ) implies V ÃÂ£ (A k )= V ÃÂ£ (A l ). oof. (i) Let ÃÆ := ÃÆ Ãï¿½ , and s := gcd(k, ÃÆ ).Ifs= ÃÆ then k is a multiple of ÃÆ and V (A k ,Ãï¿½ k )= V (A s ,Ãï¿½ s ) Theorem 7.1(i). Otherwise, since s divides k,wehaveV (A s ,Ãï¿½ s )Ã¢Å â  V (A k ,Ãï¿½ k ).Inviewoftheperi- icity (Theorem 7.1(i)), it suffices to find t such that V (A k ,Ãï¿½ k )Ã¢Å â  V (A s+tÃÆ ,Ãï¿½ s+tÃÆ ).Forthis,observe at s+ tÃÆ is a multiple of s= gcd(k, ÃÆ ).

Moreover t 1 = 0, for otherwise we have s = ÃÆ . en we obtain V ( A k ,Ãï¿½ k ) Ã¢Å â  V ( A t 1 k ,Ãï¿½ t 1 k ) = V ( A t 1 k+t 2 ÃÆ ,Ãï¿½ t 1 k+t 2 ÃÆ ) = V ( A s+tÃÆ ,Ãï¿½ s+tÃÆ ) = V ( A s ,Ãï¿½ s ) , d the first part of the claim follows. The second part is obtained similarly, using Theorem 7.1(ii) stead of Theorems 7.1(i). (ii) follows from (i). eorem 7.3. Let A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + and ÃÆ be either the cyclicity of a spectral class of A (nonnegative algebra) or the clicity of a critical component of A (max algebra). The following are equivalent for all positive k, l: i) gcd(k, ÃÆ ) divides gcd(l, ÃÆ ) for all cyclicities ÃÆ ; i) gcd(k, ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ) divides gcd(l, ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ) for all Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A); i) gcd(k, ÃÆ Ãâº ) divides gcd(l, ÃÆ Ãâº ); ) V (A k ,Ãï¿½ k )Ã¢Å â  V (A l ,Ãï¿½ l ) for all Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A) and ) V ÃÂ£ (A k )Ã¢Å â  V ÃÂ£ (A l ). oof.

By FrobeniusÃ¢â¬"Victory eorems 6.1 and 6.2 and Theorem 5.4(i), there is a unique spectral class ÃÂµ of A to which all indices supp(x) have access. Since supp(y i ) Ã¢Å â  supp(x), we are restricted to the submatrix A JJ where J the set of all indices accessing ÃÂµ in A. In other words, we can assume without loss of generality at ÃÂµ is the only final class in A,henceÃï¿½ is the greatest eigenvalue, and Ãï¿½ = 1. Note that supp(x)Ã¢ËÂ© ÃÂµ = Ã¢Ëâ¦. In nonnegative algebra, restricting the equality x= Ã¢Ë' i y i to N ÃÂµ we obtainsupp(x ÃÂµ )= Ã¢â¹Æ i supp ( y i ÃÂµ ) .

In max algebra,sinceÃï¿½ = 1, assume without loss of generality that A is strictly visualized. In this se A and x have all coordinates not exceeding 1. Recall that x [1] is the Boolean vector defined by 1] = 1 Ã¢â¡" x i = 1. Vector x corresponds to a unique critical component ÃÂµÃÅ of C(A) with the node t N ÃÂµÃÅ .

As y i is extremal, Proposition 6.3(ii) implies that supp(y i[1] ÃÂµÃÅ ) consists of all dices in a class of (A [1] ÃÂµÃÅÃÂµÃÅ ) Ã¢Å -l .Asx can be any extremal eigenvector of A Ã¢Å -k with supp(x [1] )Ã¢ËÂ© N ÃÂµÃÅ = Ã¢Ëâ¦, 1) shows that each class of (A [1] ÃÂµÃÅÃÂµÃÅ ) Ã¢Å -k splits into several classes of (A [1] ÃÂµÃÅÃÂµÃÅ ) Ã¢Å -l . By Corollary 2.2 this only possible when gcd(k, ÃÆ ) divides gcd(l, ÃÆ ), where ÃÆ is the cyclicity of the critical compo- nt ÃÂµÃÅ. Let us also formulate the following version restricted to some Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A). eorem 7.4. Let A Ã¢ËËR nÃ-n + ,andletÃÆ be either the cyclicity of a spectral class (nonnegative algebra) or the clicity of a critical component (max algebra) associated with some Ãï¿½ Ã¢ËËÃâº(A). The following are equivalent r all positive k, l: i) gcd(k, ÃÆ ) divides gcd(l, ÃÆ ) for all cyclicities ÃÆ ; i) gcd(k, ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ) divides gcd(l, ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ); ii) V (A k ,Ãï¿½ k )Ã¢Å â  V (A l ,Ãï¿½ l ). oof. (i) Ã¢â¡' (ii) follows from the elementary number theory, and (ii) Ã¢â¡' (iii) follows from (17) and mma 7.2(i). The proof of (iii)Ã¢â¡' (i) follows the lines of the proof of Theorem 7.3 (v)Ã¢â¡' (i), with a ight simplification that Ãï¿½ÃÅ = Ãï¿½ and further, x and all y i in x = Ã¢Ë' i y i are associated with the same genvalue. We are now ready to deduce Main Theorem 2. oof of Main Theorem 2. We prove the first part. The inclusion V (A k ,Ãï¿½ k )Ã¢Å â  V (A ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ,Ãï¿½ ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ) was proved Theorem 7.1(i), and we are left to show that ÃÆ Ãï¿½ is the least such p that V (A k+p ,Ãï¿½ k+p )= V (A k ,Ãï¿½ k ) r all k 1. But taking k = ÃÆ Ãï¿½ and using Theorem 7.4 (ii) Ã¢â¡" (iii), we obtain d(ÃÆ Ãï¿½ + p, ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ) = ÃÆ Ãï¿½ , implying that ÃÆ Ãï¿½ divides ÃÆ Ãï¿½ + p,soÃÆ Ãï¿½ divides p. Since Theorem 7.1(i) also ows that V (A k+ÃÆ Ãï¿½ ,Ãï¿½ k+ÃÆ Ãï¿½ )= V (A k ,Ãï¿½ k ) for all k 1, the result follows. The second part can be proved similarly, using Theorem 7.1(ii) and Theorem 7.3 (iii)Ã¢â¡" (v).
