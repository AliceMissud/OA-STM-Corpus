<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj2" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Furthermore, we have natural intuitions about the size of such sets.</text></s>

<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>More strongly, their dimension is one less than that of their ambient space, making them subsets of regular curves or surfaces.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This paper proves that these intuitions are correct.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp1" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>Our first intuition, that efficient sets should be small, is naturally thought of in the sense of Lebesgue: efficient sets in Rp should have p-dimensional measure zero.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We show that this is an immediate consequence of Lebesgue's density theorem.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Other proofs (with the additional assumption of measurability) exist in the literature; Candeal and Induráin (1994), for example, show this in the context of indifference sets.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>As a measure theoretic result, it implies the weaker topological result that efficient sets have empty interior.33</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The most common version of this is that locally non-satiated indifference curves are not thick (Arrow and Hahn, 1971; Diewert, 1973; Mas-Colell et al., 1995).</text></s>

<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>318) than their measure theoretic equivalents, they are more familiar to economists.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>While this establishes the usual understanding of nullity, Lebesgue measure fails to differentiate between sets which are of measure zero, but of very different sizes.44</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Lebesgue measure is also meaningless if p is infinite, an observation which has led to interest in concepts like 'prevalence' and 'shyness' (Mas-Colell, 1985; Hunt et al., 1992).</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This is not a concern of the present paper.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Consequently, it cannot establish our second natural intuition about efficient sets.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>For example, the straight line, the nowhere dense Cantor set formed by iteratively removing the middle third from line segments (q.v.</text></s>

<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs3" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Fig. 2) all have plane measure zero.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Thus, since Hausdorff, showing that a set has Lebesgue measure zero has simply raised a more basic problem, namely that of finding the appropriate dimension in which to then measure the set.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Furthermore, since Peano's space-filling curve in the late 19th century, a distinction has been drawn between topological and measure theoretic notions of dimension.55</text></s>

<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod9" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>As any point in the submanifold is locally homeomorphic to Rp-1, it can be described by p-1 parameters.</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Application of Sard's theorem allows conclusions about solutions' uniqueness, at least locally.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>When local uniqueness is not a desired property, the differentiability requirements of this approach are unnecessarily restrictive.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In some cases, differentiability may only fail on a null subset of a theoretically generated efficient set (e.g. the standard Leontief indifference curves); in others, such as the frontier of the production set in Jouini (1988), the failure is more pervasive.</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>In empirical work, where efficient sets are interpolated from a finite data set (e.g. data envelopment or stochastic frontier analysis), one may wish to know whether one's results are insensitive to differentiability or continuity conditions imposed by any particular interpolation technique.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod10" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>More fundamentally, though, topology's concern is shape, rather than size.</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod11" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Thus, even on metric spaces, topological dimension is an unreliable guide to size.</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod12" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>A standard example is the union of the set of rationals and the irrationals on the unit interval: each has topological dimension zero, yet their union has dimension one.66</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod13" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>More generally, the decomposition theorem states that any set in a separable, metrizable space with topological dimension ≤p may be decomposed into p+1 disjoint subsets, each with dimension ≤0 (Hurewicz and Wallman, 1941).</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod14" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>In such spaces, the coincidence theorem states that Lebesgue covering dimension, inductive dimension, and large inductive dimension-the three leading notions of topological dimension-are equivalent.</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod15" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>More generally, homeomorphic transformations-which preserve topological dimension-can be arbitrarily extreme in their distortion of measure: continuous, monotone maps may be constructed from null sets to sets with full Lebesgue measure.77</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod16" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>A classic example can be found in Gelbaum and Olmsted (1962, 8.16), which uses a Cantor function; Mehta (1991) also uses Cantor's function, in a different context.</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod17" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Thus, Hausdorff's measure theoretic understanding of dimension is used to establish our second intuition.</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod18" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>It is, by design, a more sensitive concept than either Lebesgue measure or topological dimension, being defined for any extended non-negative real number.88</text></s>

<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For non-smooth sets, Hausdorff dimension may exceed topological dimension: any curve that is homeomorphic to a circle is a one-dimensional manifold, but a sufficiently irregular curve can have Hausdorff dimension greater than one.</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res21" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This is the case for the von Koch curve, whose topological dimension is 1 (Epstein and Śniatycki, 2008).</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res22" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>(In contrast to topological dimension, Hausdorff dimension is only invariant under bi-Lipschitz transformations.)

<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res23" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Our main result is that the Hausdorff dimension of any efficient set in Rp is no more than p-1.</text></s>
<s sid="63"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res24" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This satisfies our intuition that efficient sets are (subsets of) regular curves or surfaces rather than, say, thick sets like the von Koch curve.</text></s>
