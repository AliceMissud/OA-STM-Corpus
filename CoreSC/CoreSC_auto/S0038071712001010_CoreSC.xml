Introduction
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form symbiotic associations with most terrestrial plant species (Clapp et al., 2002) and play an important role in plant nutrition (Smith et al., 2011), in protecting the plant from pathogens (Wehner et al., 2010) and from herbivorous insects (Gange et al., 2005).</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>AMF in addition to roots and saprotrophic organisms also contribute to the formation of soil structure and stabilisation (Tisdall and Oades, 1982; Six et al., 2004; Rillig and Mummey, 2006).</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Roots stabilise soil aggregates through enmeshment and by the release of organic residues that bind soil particles and support many soil organisms, which in turn produce exudates and hyphae that assist in stabilisation (Morel et al., 1991; Jastrow et al., 1998; Hinsinger et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These processes also influence the water sorptivity and repellency of soil aggregates (Czarnes et al., 2000; Traoré et al., 2000).</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>AMF are widely acknowledged to benefit soil formation and stabilisation, albeit to varying degrees.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>AMF develop extraradical hyphae which radiate away from the mycorrhizal roots into the surrounding soil.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These hyphae secrete extracellular compounds such as glomalin, glomalin-related soil proteins and polysaccharides which bind soil particles with varying degrees of physical strength and hydrophobicity (Wright and Upadhyaya, 1996, 1998; Wright and Anderson, 2000; Rillig et al., 2002).</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In addition, hyphal products influence microbiota and food webs which may in turn change the soil structure (Filion et al., 1999; Marschner and Baumann, 2003).</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Fungal mycelia also exert direct effects on soil structure when hyphae enmesh soil particles (Tisdall and Oades, 1982; Miller and Jastrow, 1990).</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Hyphal morphology, including width, wall thickness and branching characteristics differs depending on species (Rillig and Mummey, 2006), causing variability in the tensile strength applied to soil.</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Mycorrhizal fungal diversity influences plant productivity and community composition (Van der Heijden et al., 1998a; Hartnett and Wilson, 1999) and similarly, plant community diversity affects AMF species richness (Johnson et al., 2003); both factors influence soil structure.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Rillig and Mummey (2006) argued that an understanding of soil and microbial processes at different scales is required to appreciate the complexities of the systems involved.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>AMF affect individual plants by modifying root morphology (Van der Heijden et al., 1998b; Copetta et al., 2006) and altering nutrient dynamics (Oliveira et al., 2006).</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Extraradical mycelium (ERM) can have different forms of growth and different phosphate uptake efficiencies (Jakobsen et al., 1992; Helgason et al., 2002; Munkvold et al., 2004; Avio et al., 2006) that could modify plant growth and soil structure.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Van der Heijden et al. (1998b) observed that as the number of AMF taxa within the plant root increased, the shoot and root biomass increased until a certain point after which biomass declined.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Schreiner et al. (1997) reported that Glomus mosseae stabilised large aggregates (2-4 mm) whilst Glomus etunicatum and Gigaspora rosea did not.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Smaller aggregates were not affected by AMF species.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot2" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>There is therefore evidence that AMF play an important role in stabilising aggregates and in other aspects of maintaining and developing a good soil structure.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot3" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Nevertheless, there is little information on the effects different species of AMF have on aggregate stability or on soil pore dynamics, or indeed whether different AMF species in disturbed conditions have complimentary functions in relation to soil structure.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The aim of this investigation was to determine the relationship between three AMF species, a host plant and the development of soil structure in terms of aggregates and resulting porosity.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met1" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Soil macrocosms were established which contained sieved homogenous soil, assembled communities of indigenous microflora (originating from a soil-water 'slurry') and Glomus geosporum, G. mosseae and Glomus intraradices individually and in every combination.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>A split-pot design enabled quantification of the effects that roots, mycorrhizas and hyphae had on aggregate stability, aggregate size distribution, pore size and pore nearest neighbour distance.</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Drew et al. (2003) demonstrated that pore size affected morphology of G. mosseae and G. intraradices and concluded that extraradical hyphae adapt to the environment but exhibit different levels of adaptability.</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Here we determine not how the species were affected by pore size but instead, how the species modify pore size and porosity in a homogeneous soil.</text></s>

<s sid="186"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res77" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Previous studies (e.g. Bedini et al., 2009) showed that aggregate stability is affected by the plant-fungal system rather than by plant root metabolism.</text></s>

Conclusions
<s sid="194"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The results show that in a homogeneous soil, P. lanceolata roots increased aggregate size distribution (ASDcu) and aggregate stability (MWD) irrespective of whether roots were mycorrhizal or not.</text></s>
<s sid="195"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>AMF hyphae had no measurable effect on aggregate size or stability over the relatively short duration of the investigation.</text></s>
<s sid="196"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Porosity and pore size distribution were affected by AM fungal species; in particular G. mosseae hyphae produced a more complex pore network, whilst G. intraradices was associated with a more porous open pore network.</text></s>
<s sid="197"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con25" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Since pore formation and pore connectivity are key elements in understanding the structural quality of soil, knowing which AMF species has the greatest influence on these factors will enable careful decisions to be made in management practices of agroecosystems.</text></s>
