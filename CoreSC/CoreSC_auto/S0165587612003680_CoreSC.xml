Introduction
<s sid="10"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Glue ear (otitis media with effusion, OME) is the commonest cause of deafness in children in the developed world with point prevalence in the region of 20%, and up to 80% of children are affected at least temporarily by the age of 10 years [1,2].</text></s>
<s sid="11"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>OME, acute otitis media (AOM) and recurrent AOM (3 or more episodes in 6 months) are closely related clinical conditions [3].</text></s>
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>AOM represents an acute infective (bacterial and/or viral) process, whereas OME is characterised by the presence of a middle ear effusion in the absence of symptoms and signs of acute inflammation [4].</text></s>
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>OME and AOM are the leading cause of primary care visits, and the most frequent reason for antibiotics or surgery [5,6].</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Although in the majority of cases OME is transient, a proportion of children develop persistent symptoms that may affect hearing, education, language or behaviour [2].</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>If OME persists after a three month period of watchful waiting, treatment with ventilation tubes (VTs or grommets) or hearing aids may be considered [2].</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Most UK parents opt for surgery, and VT insertion is one of the commonest surgical procedures in children in the developed world [4].</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>VT insertion is currently the only effective treatment to restore hearing but it requires a general anaesthetic in children.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In addition, about a quarter of cases will require further surgical treatment within 2 years [7], with the average number of procedures per patient being 2.1 [8].</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Numerous medical treatments have also been tried.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Antibiotics particularly have received considerable attention, but although oral antibiotics are effective in resolving OME in the short term, there is no long-term benefit, and it is not a recommended treatment in the UK [2,6,9].</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Due to its major socio-economic and health care importance, much attention has focused on the aetiology of OME [6].</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>It is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the middle ear mucosa resulting in secretion of mucus that accumulates in the middle ear cleft [4,10].</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>However, the cause of the inflammatory response has been difficult to identify especially because OME is not characterised by symptoms and signs of acute inflammation that would be expected in a typical acute bacterial infection caused by planktonic bacteria; there is no pain, fever, or tympanic membrane inflammation.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot2" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>The role of bacteria in OME has therefore been controversial.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The typical bacteria implicated in OME are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae [4], but in most studies bacteria were culturable in less than half of samples, ranging from 21 to 70% [11-16].</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot3" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Although this may suggest that bacteria are not important in OME, it contrasts with studies examining effusions for the presence of bacterial nucleic acids by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which have demonstrated bacterial DNA typically in excess of 80% of effusions [4,17,18].</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot4" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>However, the presence of bacterial nucleic acids does not necessarily equate to the presence of viable bacteria as components of effusion samples have been shown to inhibit nuclease activity, and this has been postulated to cause the persistence of RNA and DNA even if bacteria are no longer viable [19].</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>A possible explanation for the discrepancy between high PCR-positive rate and low culture-positive rate in OME is the involvement of biofilms in the progression of this pathology [20].</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Indeed, biofilms have been identified on human middle ear mucosa in children with OME and/or recurrent AOM in more than 90% of cases, but not in any control samples studied [12].</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In addition to tissue surfaces, biofilms have also been identified attached to mucus [21,22] and attach in vitro to collagen gel matrix [23].</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met5" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In OME, biofilms may be attached to mucus as well as mucosa, thus providing the inflammatory stimulus leading to a middle ear effusion [10,13,24].</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met6" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>To demonstrate bacteria and biofilms in OME, an alternative approach was adopted in this study.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met7" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In addition to extended microbial culture on a wide variety of media of middle ear effusion samples taken at the time of VT insertion, effusions were also analysed using a bacterial viability stain and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The advantage of the former technique is that staining allows detection of live bacteria without requiring them to grow on culture, while CLSM demonstrates three-dimensional structure of bacterial communities typical of biofilms [25].</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The results presented here differ from data presented by Hall-Stoodley et al. in that the present analysis relates to the middle ear effusion itself, rather than the mucosal biopsies examined by previous research [12].</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>This study aimed to determine the proportion of effusion samples that could be shown to contain live bacteria on extended culture and/or CLSM with bacterial viability staining.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met8" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>We also identified the bacteria involved, and determined whether they existed as biofilms in middle ear effusions.</text></s>

Biofilms in OME
<s sid="88"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The microbiology of OME has been studied for many decades, yet controversy still exists as to the role of bacteria in the aetiology of OME [4,26].</text></s>
<s sid="89"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A high proportion of effusions (typically more than half) are culture-negative [11-16].</text></s>
<s sid="90"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, while PCR has demonstrated bacterial nucleic acids in a much greater number of patients [4,17,18], nucleic acids identified at PCR may not represent viable bacteria, even when the quantitative technique of real time PCR is used [27], although a novel technique of differentiating whether DNA comes from live or dead bacteria has recently been developed [28].</text></s>
<s sid="91"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>An alternative view of bacteria in OME is that they might be viable but not culturable by conventional means, a state that is commonly seen in biofilms [29,30].</text></s>
<s sid="92"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con6" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>An additional problem is the issue of sampling: a biofilm may be localised to only one part of the effusion, so unless the entire effusion is analysed, a localised biofilm may be missed.</text></s>
<s sid="93"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con7" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Our data add to current knowledge of bacterial and biofilm involvement in OME as we examined mucus as the site of biofilm attachment rather than mucosa, and clearly demonstrated that the bacteria were viable (something that PCR cannot do) in more than 90% of samples [4,12,20,31,32].</text></s>
<s sid="94"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con8" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Biofilms and bacterial structural components may themselves be pathogenic, and have been shown to cause inflammatory cytokine release [13,33], but may also act as a reservoir of bacteria, with some bacteria leaving the biofilm to become planktonic and disseminated.</text></s>
<s sid="95"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res21" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>While bacteria in biofilm mode are usually in dormant phase and do not, for instance, produce toxins or invasion-related virulence factors, this facility can be restored on reversion to planktonic mode [34].</text></s>
<s sid="96"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res22" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Using CLSM we were able to detect biofilms in just under half of CLSM-positive samples.</text></s>

<s sid="99"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con9" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This suggests that CLSM may under-estimate the presence of bacteria, perhaps due to sampling differences, especially important where small samples of effusion were divided between several tests.</text></s>
<s sid="100"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res25" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>There appeared to be no great difference between planktonic and biofilm bacteria identified on LCSM-positive samples, with similar numbers being culture-positive.</text></s>
<s sid="101"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res26" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Although one might have expected all samples containing planktonic bacteria to have been culture-positive according to the non-culturable biofilm theory, 16 such effusions were culture-negative.</text></s>
<s sid="102"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res27" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It is possible that these bacteria did exist in biofilm form (which would make them difficult to culture), but that their original morphology was disturbed by the process of surgical aspiration or laboratory preparation/mixing.</text></s>
<s sid="103"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res28" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The fact that some effusions containing biofilms on confocal microscopy were culture positive is not surprising as bacteria from biofilms frequently leave the biofilm to enter the planktonic state (and would therefore be culturable), and processing of samples for analysis may also disrupt the biofilm thus rendering the bacteria planktonic and the culture positive.</text></s>
<s sid="104"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res29" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Children's effusions appeared to be more likely to contain biofilms than adults, in keeping with the expected infective aetiology of OME in children but a possibly different aetiology in adults [4].</text></s>
<s sid="105"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con10" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>No great correlation between findings in the opposite ears has been demonstrated, suggesting that individual ears may be subject to different local aetiopathogenic mechanisms.</text></s>

<s sid="107"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res31" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Although the BacLight stain enables differentiation only between bacteria with intact and damaged cytoplasmic membranes it is often used to differentiate between active and dead cells [35,36], and while it appears to be reasonable to consider membrane-compromised bacterial cells as dead, the reverse (i.e. intact membrane signifies live cells) may not be true in a small number of cases [35].</text></s>

<s sid="114"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con12" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Infection is difficult or impossible to eradicate with antibiotics, despite the responsible bacteria being susceptible to the antibiotic when in the planktonic state.</text></s>
<s sid="115"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con13" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Our results show that extended culture techniques and confocal microscopy together can identify live bacteria in 92% of cases, and we found biofilms in just under half of effusions.</text></s>
<s sid="116"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con14" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Although studies of middle ear mucosa have shown biofilms in most (but not all) samples, this does not necessarily contradict our findings as there are several reasons why this difference between mucosa and mucus may exist [12,32].</text></s>
<s sid="117"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is possible that biofilms exist on the mucosa in most people with OME but exist within the effusion associated with mucins in only just under half of cases, or that biofilms on mucosa act as reservoirs of bacteria that then enter the effusion, or that there is an issue with which part of the effusion is sampled for analysis.</text></s>
<s sid="118"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The presence of an intact mucus layer appears to be important in controlling bacteria within the human gastro-intestinal tract as most bacteria reside on the luminal side of the mucus layer [37], with no direct contact with the epithelium unless inflammation is present [38,39].</text></s>
<s sid="119"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Could biofilms be a part of the normal middle ear flora rather than the pathogenic cause of OME? While Hall-Stoodley [12] did not find any biofilms in their healthy controls, another study [40] of middle ear mucosal biopsy at time of cochlear implant showed biofilms in 2 out of 45 cases without evidence of previous otologic problems or abnormalities, suggesting that biofilms may exist in the asymptomatic middle ear.</text></s>
<s sid="120"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The difficulty when researching biofilms in OME is choice of control group.</text></s>
<s sid="121"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con19" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Entirely normal patients do not require ear surgery, and all the control groups chosen are patients having surgery for another (ostensibly non-related) reason, but they cannot be considered to be normal.</text></s>
<s sid="122"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con20" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>When studying effusions as in this study, the problem is compounded by the fact that the normal ear does not have an effusion, therefore no suitable negative control exists.</text></s>
<s sid="123"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con21" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>A further problem relates to the common phenomenon of temporary OME, so it possible that children considered &quot;normal&quot; may have biofilms in their middle ear because they have a temporary problem that would never come to medical attention otherwise.</text></s>
<s sid="124"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Nevertheless, the presence of a biofilm may lead to an inflammatory stimulus that results in middle ear mucosal inflammation and therefore clinical OME [10,13].</text></s>
<s sid="125"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Biofilms have also been found in patients with cholesteatoma and chronic suppurative otitis media [32,41].</text></s>
Bacterial types in OME
<s sid="126"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae are the most common pathogens implicated in OME, and all are capable of forming biofilms [33,42].</text></s>
<s sid="127"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con25" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, rather than focusing just on those three bacteria, this study cultured effusions on a wide range of different media for prolonged time periods in order to capture as many isolates as possible.</text></s>
<s sid="128"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con26" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Interestingly, coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS), Veillonella spp.</text></s>
<s sid="129"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con27" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>and S. aureus were the three commonest pathogens isolated in this study.</text></s>
<s sid="130"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con28" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>CoNS were long thought to be non-pathogenic commensals, but with the recognition of their biofilm-forming capacity have emerged as the leading cause of biomaterials-related infection [43,43].</text></s>
<s sid="131"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con29" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>S. lugdunensis, isolated here on three occasions, in particular has been implicated in endocarditis, wound infection, and implant-related infection as well as otitis media, behaving more like S. aureus than other CoNS [45].</text></s>
<s sid="132"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con30" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Other CoNS have also been previously implicated in otitis media, with a recent study finding that they account for 60% of bacteria isolated from OME [46,47].</text></s>
<s sid="133"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con31" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Veillonella is a Gram-negative anaerobe that inhabits the mouth and upper respiratory tract, forms biofilms [48] and has previously been found in middle ear disease [49,50].</text></s>
<s sid="134"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con32" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>S. aureus also forms biofilms and has been identified in middle ear disease [51,52].</text></s>
<s sid="135"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con33" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Although most of the bacteria in Table 2 have previously been isolated in middle ear disease, to the best of the authors' knowledge Flavimonas oryzihabitans, Vibrio metschnikovii and Gemella haemolysans have not been implicated previously.</text></s>
<s sid="136"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con34" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is unclear why the present study identified the three traditional OME bacteria in a lower proportion of samples than other studies.</text></s>
<s sid="137"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con35" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Although the samples in this study may have been cultured for longer periods of time (with the intention of identifying slow-growing species) than is typical in the routine diagnostic laboratory, the authors do not consider that results represent contamination as stringent precautions were taken.</text></s>
<s sid="138"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con36" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Variation in prevalence of OME over time has been previously documented [16], and may be due to patterns of antibiotic use or vaccination, particularly with the introduction of vaccines against H. influenzae type b and S. pneumoniae.</text></s>
<s sid="139"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con37" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The adoption of a broad microbiological approach in this study with the aim of identification of all bacteria may also have detected species missed by studies adopting a narrower culturing approach.</text></s>
<s sid="140"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con38" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Confocal microscopy itself does not allow identification of bacterial species, therefore Hall-Stoodley et al. have characterised bacteria by fluorescence in situ hybridisation [12].</text></s>
<s sid="141"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con39" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, as bacterial identification is obtained only when a species-specific probe is used, this approach is not suitable when trying to identify every species as part of a strategy aimed at identifying the broadest possible range of bacterial species.</text></s>
<s sid="142"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res37" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Although numbers of isolates of any one bacterial species are small, it is interesting to note that majority of samples that grew CoNS and S. aureus on culture appeared to contain planktonic bacteria on confocal microscopy, despite both being well-recognised as biofilm-forming pathogens [43,44,51].</text></s>
<s sid="143"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res38" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is well known to produce biofilms [42] was also identified in biofilm morphology in this study, but Acinetobacter appeared difficult to detect on CLSM.</text></s>
Glue ear treatment
<s sid="144"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con40" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This study clearly implicates bacteria in the aetiopathogenesis of OME.</text></s>
<s sid="145"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con41" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Our study finds biofilms in 49.0% of confocal-positive effusions, and previous research has demonstrated them on more than 90% of mucosal biopsies in children with OME or recurrent AOM [12].</text></s>
<s sid="146"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con42" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This new understanding of OME aetiology also leads to potentially novel therapeutic possibilities that may improve current management options.</text></s>
<s sid="147"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con43" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>At present, treatment of persistent symptomatic OME involves drainage of the effusion and VT insertion, but this does not address any persistent bacterial infection, and serves to merely remove the effusion that is the result of a middle ear inflammation.</text></s>
<s sid="148"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con44" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is therefore perhaps not surprising that about a quarter of cases will require further surgical treatment within 2 years, and the average number of procedures per child is greater than two [7,8].</text></s>
<s sid="149"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con45" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Unlike planktonic bacteria, which would be expected to respond to conventional antibiotic treatment, bacteria in biofilms adopt a distinct phenotype with a slow growth rate that makes them recalcitrant to standard antibacterial therapy [42,53,54].</text></s>
<s sid="150"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con46" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, novel antibacterial strategies such as locally delivered high-dose antibiotics over a prolonged time period [53,54] or new drug delivery systems and antimicrobial-impregnated devices appear promising [53,55,56], and other novel techniques such as ultrasound [57,58], low-strength electrical fields [59], enzymatic degradation of extracellular matrix [60], inhibition of quorum sensing [61-63], disruption of biofilm-related genes, or indeed a combination of the above in a smart system that detects and treats biofilm infection [64] might be of interest.</text></s>
<s sid="151"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con47" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, at present the application of these approaches to OME remains speculative.</text></s>
Conclusion
<s sid="152"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con48" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The role of bacteria in OME has been controversial, with a long-held debate fuelled by the low number of effusions that are culture-positive and the controversy over whether PCR-positive samples indicate live bacteria.</text></s>
<s sid="153"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con49" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, this study, using extended cultures and confocal microscopy, demonstrates live bacteria in more than 90% of middle ear effusions in children with glue ear, strongly suggesting that bacteria and biofilms are important in the pathogenesis of the condition.</text></s>
