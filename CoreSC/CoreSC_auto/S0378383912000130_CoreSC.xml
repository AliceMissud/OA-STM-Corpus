Introduction
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Bore-driven swash on unsaturated coarse-grained beaches generates several interacting physical processes: surface flow over the beach face, infiltration into the initially unsaturated part of the beach, air entrapment below the wetting front (Steenhauer et al., 2011a) and groundwater flow.</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Surface flow is commonly modelled using the Non-Linear Shallow Water Equations (NLSWEs); examples of such models are reviewed in Brocchini and Dodd (2008).</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Many swash models account for groundwater flow (Clarke et al., 2004; Lara et al., 2006; Van Gent, 1994; Wurjanto and Kobayashi, 1993), but few include simulation of water infiltration into the unsaturated part of the beach (Dodd et al., 2008; Packwood, 1983; Steenhauer et al., 2011b), and, to the authors' knowledge, none simulates air movement within the beach.</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, the field investigations of Horn (2002, 2006) and a recent laboratory study by Steenhauer et al.

Model description
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met10" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The conceptual model of bore-driven swash on coarse-grained beaches is based on the experimental findings of Steenhauer et al.

<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj10" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In the lower region of the beach the 'piston' has merged with the groundwater, so the whole depth of the beach is saturated.</text></s>

<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Similarly, groundwater movement is indeed reasonably close to being one-dimensional in the region where the wetting front has not yet reached the groundwater table, but the assumption of one-dimensional horizontal flow is less justified for the region where the beach is fully saturated.</text></s>
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj11" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Although the assumptions of flow one-dimensionality are not fully justified everywhere in the model, the model captures the main features of swash on coarse-grained beaches well, including the air pressure build-up and subsequent shoreward migration.</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It must be pointed out that our model, as well as the experimental results of Steenhauer et al. (2011a), apply for conditions where the incident bore does not vary in the long-shore direction, which means that air trapped below the wetting front and above the groundwater table, cannot escape in the long-shore direction.</text></s>

The work was conducted in conjunction with EPSRC-funded research (grant number EP/E011330/1) at the University of Aberdeen.

The value for dhif,n* is obtained from the infiltration module.
The method for obtaining the value for dhiη,n* is based on a quick procedure of the groundwater module described in Appendix C.
The system of equations for the groundwater module is combined into a linear system expressed for one computational cell i as:(23)Ki-1/2wa1Hi-1η,n+1-(Ki-1/2wa1+Ki+1/2wa2+a4)Hiη,n+1+Ki+1/2wa2Hi+1η,n+1=-B1+B2where the individual coefficients of system (23) for the confined and unconfined region of the beach are given as:(24)a1=hiη,n+hi-1η,n2Δxa2=hiη,n+hi+1η,n2Δxa3=Δxzib-zica4={Kiwa3:Iteration1for confined beach(Darcy flux forq)0:Iteration2for confined beach(Forchheimer law forq)θΔxΔt:Unconfined beachB1=Ki-1/2Wa1Hi-1η,n-(Ki-1/2Wa1+Ki+1/2Wa2)Hiη,n+Ki+1/2Wa2Hi+1η,nB2={-Kia3[(WHih,n+wHih,n+1)-WHiη,n]:Iteration1forconfinedbeach-Δxqi:Iteration2forconfinedbeacha4(-pia,n+1ρg-Hiη,n+pia,nρg):Unconfinedbeachwhere 0≤w≤1 denotes the weighting coefficient, where W=(1-w), Hiη is the hydraulic head within the beach in cell i, for the unconfined region of the beach Hiη=hiη+piaρg, hiη is the height of the groundwater in cell i, pia is the air pressure within the unsaturated cell i, ρ is the density of water, g is the gravitational acceleration, Hih is the hydraulic head at the level of the bed based on the surface flow (Hih=zib+hih+pAρg), pA is the atmospheric pressure and qi is the vertical flux expressed in Eq. (20).
The hydraulic conductivity within system (23) is calculated as Ki-1/2=1/(aK+bKcK|ui-1/2p|), where aK and bK are the Forchheimer coefficients, and where the horizontal pore velocity is given by up,i-1/2=Qi-1/2η12(hiη+hi-1η) and where the coefficient cK has a value of 0.9 obtained by model calibration.
In the first iteration the value for the hydraulic conductivity, Ki-1/2, is taken at previous time tn.
In the second iteration the value, Ki-1/2, is updated based on the hydraulic head results obtained from the first iteration.
The seaward boundary of system (23) for the groundwater module is described in the last paragraph of Appendix C.
This section describes the quick procedure of the groundwater module used in calculating the predicted change in groundwater levels within the unconfined region of the beach for the air flow module (see the coupling of flow modules in Fig. 4).
A trial value for the change in groundwater level, dhiη,n∗, is only evaluated for unconfined region of the beach, where the air is entrapped between the wetting front and the groundwater.
Flow through the entire confined region (from the toe of the beach until the most shoreward confined cell, s, Fig. 15) is evaluated using the average horizontal hydraulic gradient across the beach and the Darcian approximation of flow resistance.
The hydraulic gradient is expressed using the hydraulic head at the beach surface at a cross-section M situated in the middle of the fully saturated region, i.e. at xM=12(xtoe+xs+1/2):(25)HMη=zMb+hM+pAρgwhere hM is the water depth above the bed, with the value taken at time level tn+1, pA is the atmospheric pressure and zMb is the level of the bed surface at xM.
The discharge from the confined region into the unconfined region is therefore evaluated as:(26)Qs+1/2η=Khsη+hs+1η2HMη-Hs+1ηxs+1/2-xM
Position of cell s varies with time, as the confined part of the beach becomes longer when the wetting front reaches the groundwater further in the beach (Fig. 15).
The discharge, Qs+1/2η, is the boundary condition for the unconfined groundwater module.
The module itself uses the procedure described in Section 2.4 and Appendix B, but it is now fully explicit, i.e. w=0, and Darcian, i.e.
K=1/aK.
This means that the groundwater level in each unconfined cell can be calculated directly from Eq. (23).
Similar simplified treatment is applied to the left-hand boundary of the groundwater module described in Appendix B.
The discharge through the fully saturated region of the beach between the toe of the beach and the position of the initial shoreline (approximately x=-600 and 0mm) is calculated from Eq.
(26), with HMη based on Eq.
(25) taking for xM, the position midway between the toe of the beach and the initial shoreline.
The resulting relationship is the seaward boundary condition for the groundwater model.
It provides direct coupling between the surface flow and the horizontal groundwater flow.
Table 2 gives a list of symbols.
