Introduction
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The PETM was a period of geologically-rapid global warming that punctuated a warming Eocene climate 55.8Ma ago (Charles et al., 2011), and saw sea surface temperatures rise by 5-8°C from background levels (Zachos et al., 2005; Sluijs et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>It was associated with a substantial injection of δ13C-depleted carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system (see Pagani et al., 2006a) over &lt;20ka (Cui et al., 2011), causing a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) between -2 and -7‰ in marine and terrestrial sediments (see overview in Schouten et al., 2007) lasting 170ka (Röhl et al., 2007), and a prominent dissolution horizon in the deep sea signifying deep ocean acidification (Kennett and Stott 1991; Zachos et al., 2005).</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The source and rate of released carbon are still under debate (Pagani et al., 2006a; Zeebe et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2011), but may have been linked to the dissociation of marine hydrates containing biogenic methane (δ13C of&lt;-60‰) (Dickens et al., 1995), thermogenic methane from marine sediments around the Norwegian Sea (Svensen et al., 2004), or dissolved methane from a silled Kilda Basin between Greenland and Norway (Nisbet et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The PETM may be a good analogue to test modelling studies that suggest current global warming trends may result in an enhanced hydrologic cycle (Seager et al., 2010), whereby increased precipitation in temperate rain belts is coupled with increased evaporation in lower latitudes.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Modelling studies of the PETM have further indicated the potential importance of an increased hydrologic cycle (Lunt et al., 2010; Bice and Marotzke 2002), which could have altered ocean circulation causing methane hydrate reservoirs to destabilise, triggering massive carbon release (Bice and Marotzke, 2002).</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Palynological evidence from Arctic Spitsbergen (Harding et al., 2011) and New Zealand (Crouch et al., 2003a) suggests increased terrestrial runoff occurred at the onset of the CIE which may be related to hydrologic changes, and massive Pyrenees conglomerate deposits have been interpreted as the result of an abrupt increase in extreme precipitation within the early CIE (Schmitz and Pujalte, 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In addition, hydrogen and carbon isotope measurements of terrestrial plant and aquatic-derived n-alkanes from the central Arctic Ocean indicate that the core of the PETM was associated with increased precipitation and hence hydrologic cycle (Pagani et al., 2006b), although the onset of PETM warming was not recovered in the sediment core.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Despite numerous additional evidence for changes in terrestrial runoff and potentially hydrology during the PETM (see overview in McInterney and Wing, 2011), there is a lack of clear evidence for hydrologic changes from high resolution sections able to resolve important lead/lag relationships, and therefore there remains a need for studies of hydrologic changes in sensitive locations over the onset of the CIE in order to understand the relationship between precipitation and global carbon release.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot2" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Biome changes in response to modern global warming have been observed, but approaches to predict the vulnerability of ecosystems to future changes are still in development (Gonzalez et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Vegetation shifts during the rapid warming associated with the PETM may provide a useful analogue to future biome responses.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Whilst neotropical vegetation in Central America appears to have responded to warming during the PETM with increased diversity and origination rates (Jaramillo et al., 2010), central North America experienced a rapid migration of plant communities associated with lower precipitation at the onset of the CIE (Wing et al., 2005), and southern England may have experienced a major change in plant composition due to changes in local fire-regime (Collinson et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>To better understand biome responses to climatic change during the PETM, further high resolution vegetation cover studies are needed, specifically from temperate and boreal forests which may be amongst the most vulnerable ecosystems to global warming (Gonzalez et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj1" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In this study we focus on paleoenvironmental signals from a high resolution marine core collected from the central North Sea (Fig. 1), in order to understand changes to precipitation, ocean stratification, productivity and vegetation over the onset of the PETM.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj2" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>This core is located in a critical region proximal to the NAIP, as there are currently no high resolution records of environmental change during the PETM from the North Sea Basin.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Furthermore, as overturning of a stratified Kilda Basin at the CIE onset is hypothesised as a possible trigger for dissolved methane release to the atmosphere (Nisbet et al., 2009), analysing the stratification history of the nearby North Sea is a possible way to test this hypothesis.</text></s>
Regional setting
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj4" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>During the late Paleocene-early Eocene the North Sea was a restricted marine basin, characterised by siliciclastic sedimentation and high terrigenous input, principally from the Scotland-Faeroe-Shetland landmass (Knox 1998, Fig.</text></s>
S1).
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Core 22/10a-4 is located in the central part of the basin (Figs.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>1 and S1) and is therefore disconnected from many marginal marine processes that could mask oceanographic signals (e.g. tidal or storm-induced erosion and slumping).</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Paleobathymetry estimates in the North Sea during the Paleocene and Eocene are difficult to constrain accurately, as the extant benthic foraminifera present in the Paleogene are found today living between 200 and &gt;1000m water depth (Gradstein et al., 1992), and are controlled predominantly by substrate and bottom water properties.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However using a number of paleoecologic micropaleontology methods together (Gillmore et al., 2001), along with 2D structural restoration (Kjennerud and Sylta, 2001), broad agreement was found and central parts of the northern North Sea appear to have had paleodepths of &gt;0.5km in the earliest Eocene near 22/10a-4 (Kjennerud and Gillmore, 2003, Fig. S1).</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>As 22/10a-4 is in the deep (&gt;0.5km) central part of the basin, it acted as a depocentre and exhibits a Paleocene-Eocene transition sequence that is not only expanded but is also close to being stratigraphically complete.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The only evidence for breaks in the succession is minor erosion at the base of thin turbidite sandstones (typically &lt;10cm).</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Because these sandstones may contain reworked material, they were not sampled in this study.</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>During the late Paleocene, the basin became restricted following a fall in in the order of 100m that resulted from regional uplift associated with the proto-Iceland mantle plume in the North Atlantic (see Knox, 1996).</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This event is evident in 22/10a-4 as a lithologic change from unbedded to bedded mudstone (the Lista and Sele Formation boundary, Fig. 2).</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res21" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Restriction of the basin also led to the establishment of poorly oxygenated bottom waters, as is evident by a shift in the benthic foraminiferal assemblages towards low diversity low oxygen-tolerant agglutinated species (Knox, 1996).</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The CIE at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary was accompanied by a relative sea level rise, as documented in southeast England (Powell et al., 1996) and Spitsbergen (Harding et al., 2011), due to the thermal expansion of sea water and possible melting of ice caps, although the North Sea basin remained restricted as evidenced by the persistence of low oxygen facies in 22/10a-4.</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The North Sea had a widespread freshwater catchment area, and a halocline was in place from the late Paleocene to early Eocene (Zacke et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res22" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Therefore, surface water salinity changes in the North Sea Basin provide a sensitive gauge for stratification forced by changes in tectonics and the hydrologic cycle.</text></s>

<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res24" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The core consists of variably fissile claystone with interbedded fine to coarse grained sandstone layers interpreted as turbidites, with occasional mm-thick ash layers (Fig. 3).</text></s>
