Introduction
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In most natural environments such as soils, individual organisms do not live in isolation but rather form a complex system of inter-species interactions that, to a large extent, determine the structure of an ecological community (Freilich et al., 2010), and consequently the function of the ecosystem (Fuhrman, 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, interactions and the resulting ecological functions are usually difficult to elucidate, especially for soils.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Furthermore, most previous analytical techniques can be used to describe community composition, diversity and their changes across space, time, or experimental treatments, but cannot be used to reveal interactions among community members, which could be more important to ecosystem functioning than abundance and diversity, especially in complex ecosystems (Deng et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Network analysis is proven to be a powerful tool in revealing the interactions among entities in a system, such as individuals in a school (Moody, 2001), species in food webs (Krause et al., 2003; Woodward et al., 2012), nodes on a computer network (Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001; Volchenkov et al., 2002), proteins in metabolic pathways (Brohée et al., 2008; Guimera and Amaral, 2005), and genes in regulatory networks (Crombach and Hogeweg, 2008).</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Yet, until recently, researchers begun to use this tool to study complex microbial ecological systems such as marine bacterioplankton (Gilbert et al., 2012), global environments in 16S rRNA dataset (Chaffron et al., 2010), fully sequenced bacterial species (Freilich et al., 2010), dental biofilm (Duran-Pinedo et al., 2011), human microbiome (Faust et al., 2012; Greenblum et al., 2012), bacterial communities in variety of soil samples (Barberan et al., 2012), and the communities in soils influenced by elevated CO2 (Deng et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2010, 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Despite its pitfalls (Faust and Raes, 2012), the power and usefulness of network analysis in revealing new information on community member interactions, community organizations, keystone organisms, and their responses to environmental factors that cannot be revealed by routine analytical techniques is unequivocally demonstrated.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For example, Zhou et al. (2011) demonstrated that Actinobacteria were the keystone bacteria connecting different co-expressed OTUs and were significantly correlated with selected soil variables.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Similarly, Faust et al. (2012) predicted novel interactions involving members of under-characterized phyla, providing valuable information on further co-culturing of these organisms.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Further, Duran-Pinedo et al. (2011) were even able to identify a helper bacterium successfully helping an uncultured bacterium to show up in petri dishes.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Network analysis probably represents a new direction in microbial ecology research (Zhou et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Crop monoculture has long been considered un-sustainable as it often leads to yield decline (Shipton, 1977).</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The yield decline usually occurs after two or three years of monoculture (as in this study), depending on crops, number of years and soil, and is usually attributed to the increase of yield-debilitating populations and switches of underground microbial communities (van Elsas et al., 2002).</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>However, to date, the questions, such as what species compose yield-debilitating soil microbial community, how a yield-invigorating community is shifted to a yield-debilitating one, and what are the key soil factors responsible for the shift remain unclear.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>By farmers' term, the soils under limited length of monoculture (2-3 years) still producing sound yields are called &quot;healthy&quot; soils whereas those under prolonged monoculture producing unacceptably low yields are called &quot;diseased&quot; soils.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Because the farmers' terms &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;diseased&quot; are simpler than yield-invigorating and yield-debilitating respectively, they are adopted hereafter for concise purpose.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The purpose of present study is to address these questions by a network analysis approach, using the &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;diseased&quot; soils induced by prolonged potato monoculture as model soils.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>It has long been recognized that the yield decline under prolonged monoculture is associated with soilborne pathogens (Shipton, 1977), many of which are fungi (Fiers et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac19" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In present study, major potato diseases found in field included fusarium dry rots, late bright and black scurf/stem canker that are associated with Fusarium sps., Phytophthora infestans, Rhizoctonia solani respectively, all of which are soilborne fungal pathogens (Fiers et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac20" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Soil fungal community is thus the focus of present study.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp1" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>We hypothesized that a healthy community is likely to be better organized or better operated than a diseased community with respect to network organization and keystone organisms.</text></s>
