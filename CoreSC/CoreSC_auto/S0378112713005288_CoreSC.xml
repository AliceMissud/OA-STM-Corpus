Introduction
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Timber plantations have been widely established across Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes (Zerbe, 2002; Yamagawa et al., 2010) with plantation forests now making up 14% of total forest area in western European countries (Forest Europe, 2011) and about 70% of total forest area in Britain (Brockerhoff et al., 2008).</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These plantation forests usually consist of fast-growing, non-native conifer species located on marginal agricultural land in the uplands (Humphrey et al., 2006).</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>They are typically intensively managed for timber production with substantial site preparation before planting (e.g., ploughing, drainage, and occasional use of fertiliser) and harvesting of timber occurring by clearfelling after a relatively short rotation.</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Whilst plantation forests can provide habitat for a range of species (Humphrey et al., 2000; Quine and Humphrey, 2010; Bremer and Farley, 2010; Coote et al., 2012), semi-natural woodlands typically contain greater biological diversity (Brockerhoff et al., 2008; Bremer and Farley, 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Furthermore, plantation forests can result in soil and stream acidification (Carling et al., 2001) as well as potential negative impacts on water resources.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Recently, a greater interest in woodlands for their ecological and recreational value means that semi-natural and mixed forests consisting of native species are becoming increasingly valued (Felton et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>As many plantations are now reaching the end of their rotations, there is considerable potential for establishment of semi-natural woodland on former plantation forest sites (Spiecker et al., 2004; Dedrick et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod1" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The restoration of plantation forests to semi-natural woodland can be carried out through a range of methods.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod2" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The conifer crop can either be clearfelled or the trees can be removed more gradually through multiple thinning operations.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>There are also a range of methods for establishing native trees including planting, direct seeding or natural regeneration.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Natural regeneration is the establishment of trees from seeds produced in situ (Harmer and Kerr, 1995) and is the preferred means of achieving native woodland expansion in Great Britain (Forestry Commission, 1994).</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Potential advantages of natural regeneration include the preservation of local genotypes and greater structural diversity of the resulting woodland (Peterken, 1996), high seedling density (Holgén and Hånell, 2000) as well as increased cost-effectiveness (Tarp et al., 2000; Jonásová et al., 2006).</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Natural regeneration has been studied in a range of environments including degraded lowland tropical pasture (Parrotta et al., 1997), tropical mountain forests (Holl et al., 2000), boreal forest (Peltzer et al., 2000; Holgén and Hånell, 2000; Hanssen, 2003; Man et al., 2008; Man et al., 2009), lowland European forests (Madsen and Larsen, 1997; Emborg, 1998; Olesen and Madsen, 2008; Modrý et al., 2004; Swagrzyk et al., 2001; Harmer and Morgan, 2009; Wagner et al., 2010; Smit et al., 2012) and European mountain forests (Jonásová et al., 2010; Bace et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, the regeneration of native species on clearfelled conifer plantations is still poorly understood (Zerbe, 2002) with Wallace (1998)'s study of birch regeneration in clearfelled spruce plantations the only previous study in upland Britain.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Here we report the first extensive study of natural regeneration of native hardwood species on clearfelled upland conifer plantations in Britain.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj4" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>We addressed the following questions: (i) How well do native tree species regenerate on clearfelled upland conifer plantations? (ii) How does regeneration on clearfelled conifer plantations compare to regeneration on improved farmland and open moorland? (iii) What are the dominant factors controlling regeneration? (iv) How does the ground flora develop in the years following clearfelling and how does this impact tree regeneration?</text></s>

<s sid="159"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res70" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The determination of any relationship between vascular plant cover and regeneration density was complicated by the constantly changing nature of ground flora - the current vegetation structure does not necessarily reflect that present when the seedlings first started growing.</text></s>

<s sid="161"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con6" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The small size of a birch seed means that its food reserve is only sufficient to grow to 2cm in height (Miles and Kinnaird, 1979), before it must be able to support itself through photosynthesis.</text></s>

<s sid="165"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con10" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In contrast, the lack of regeneration seen on the unplanted upland moorland and unplanted improved farmland sites is likely due to the dense flora coverage (120% and 142% respectively) in combination with the lack of any ground disturbance.</text></s>
<s sid="166"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res72" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The rate of tree growth was slow, with regenerating trees achieving a median height of 104cm after 10years of growth post-felling.</text></s>

<s sid="168"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res74" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We found that the height distribution of the regenerating trees changed with time since clearfelling (Fig. 3), with large numbers of small trees 4years post-felling changing to a more even distribution of heights 10years post-felling.</text></s>
<s sid="169"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con11" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This indicates that the recruitment of new trees is most prolific in the first few years following felling, with fewer seedlings 10years post-felling indicating a slowdown in this process.</text></s>
<s sid="170"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con12" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This decline is likely to be driven by the increase in herbaceous cover following clearfelling combined with the negative correlation between birch regeneration and herbaceous cover.</text></s>

<s sid="176"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac21" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Furthermore, previous studies have found that where grazing pressure is high, brash (Truscott et al., 2004) and coarse woody debris (Smit et al., 2012) can help protect seedlings from browsing.</text></s>
