Introduction
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj7" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Wind turbines are generally divided into horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) and vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) [1].</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj8" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>This work focuses on the VAWT, which is omnidirectional, implying that a yaw mechanism is not needed.</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met1" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Another advantage of the VAWT is that the vertical axis allows the generator to be placed on ground, which simplifies construction and maintenance.</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>A disadvantage of this design is that at low tip speed ratios(1)λ=rωV∞,the turbine torque is low, which implies that the generator has to be operated as a motor to start the turbine.</text></s>
In Eq.
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod1" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>(1), r is the turbine radius, ω is the turbine rotational velocity and V∞ is the asymptotic wind speed.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod2" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Another characteristic feature of the VAWT is the cyclic loads from the aerodynamic forces on the blades.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>A common design consideration is if a pitch mechanism should be included or not.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The most common design is a HAWT with pitch regulation, where the turbine characteristics can be changed by varying the blade pitch angle [2].</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp1" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>Pitch control for a VAWT has been used to improve performance for turbines operating at low tip speed ratios by avoiding stall [3,4].</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The present investigation considers turbines optimised for higher λ, where the effects of stall are much smaller.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Pitch regulation of a VAWT further requires that the pitch angle is changed around the entire revolution, and such a mechanism is an additional source of mechanical failure.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Furthermore, many models for pitch control of a VAWT require knowledge of the wind direction, adding the requirement for additional sensors [5,6].</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj9" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>For these reasons, pitch is not investigated here.</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Instead, this paper considers a more robust way to control the turbine, where the turbine rotational velocity is the only control parameter.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The rotational velocity can be controlled via the power extracted by the generator (c.f.</text></s>
Fig. 1).
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met5" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The investigation here treats control strategies which operate without measurements of the wind speed and where the generator torque is determined from the rotational velocity of the turbine.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Similar strategies have been applied for HAWTs [7], but the low aerodynamic power of VAWTs at low λ requires a separate investigation into the applicability of these models for the vertical axis case.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The study of the control system is based on an aerodynamic simulation model for the turbine performance coupled with a model for the electrical system.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj10" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The control system is embedded into the electrical system.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj11" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>This approach gives full control of the input parameters and makes a study of the performance of the complete system possible.</text></s>
Control theory
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod3" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The power extracted from a turbine is(2)P=12CPρAV∞3,where A is the turbine area, ρ is the fluid density and CP is the power coefficient.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The power coefficient is primarily a function of the tip speed ratio but does also depend on the Reynolds number, as can be seen in Fig. 2, where the turbine has been simulated for different wind speeds.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Turbine details are described in Section 5.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The peak of the power coefficient curves occurs at approximately the same tip speed ratio λmax.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The peak value of the power coefficient, CPmax, is higher for higher wind speeds since the stall angle increases and the drag decreases for a wing with increased Reynolds number.</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met6" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The angular acceleration of the turbine is determined by(3)ω˙=P-PeJω,where Pe is the total mechanical power absorbed by the generator and J is the combined angular inertia of the turbine and drive train.</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met7" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Most control strategies strive to maintain the λ that optimises CP by varying Pe.</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met8" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>One way to accomplish this is to rely on real-time measurements of the wind speed, combined with an estimate of λmax.</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj12" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>This paper investigates control strategies where the extracted power is determined from the rotor speed alone, i.e.</text></s>
Pe=Pe(ω).
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Fig. 1 shows the variation of aerodynamic power, P, with the rotational velocity for a given wind speed.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>In the same figure, an example of a control strategy based on the extracted power is illustrated.</text></s>
According to Eq.
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>(3), the turbine will increase its rotational velocity whenever P&gt;Pe, decrease its rotational velocity if P&lt;Pe and the control strategy will have an equilibrium whenever P=Pe.</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In the case of Fig. 1, there is one stable region for high rotational velocities, while for too low rotational velocities, the extracted power is higher than the aerodynamic power and the turbine will stop.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The speed of the control strategy depends on the difference between the turbine torque T=P/ω and the generator torque Te=Pe/ω, as this is the torque that accelerates/decelerates the turbine, see Eq.</text></s>
(3).
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>If this strategy operates at the stable equilibrium and there is an increase in wind speed, the aerodynamic power will increase, hence P&gt;Pe and the turbine will accelerate until a new equilibrium is reached (compare with Fig. 5).</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Similarly, a decrease in wind speed will decrease the turbine rotational velocity.</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The aim of the control strategy is, for each wind speed, to have a stable equilibrium at a rotational velocity that gives a high power coefficient.</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>To tune this strategy for the highest power coefficient at a given wind speed, both λmax and CPmax have to be known at this speed.</text></s>
Studied control strategies
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met9" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>One control strategy is to adjust the extracted power to be proportional to the cube of the rotational velocity (strategy A),(4)Pe*=k2ω3,where k2 is a constant and Pe* is the target mechanical power.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met10" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This control strategy has been used for HAWTs before, see Ref.</text></s>
[7].
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs3" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The normalised extracted power is(5)CPe=Pe*12ρAV∞3,which, by using Eqs.</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs4" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>(1) and (4), can be rewritten as(6)CPe=k212ρAλ3R3.</text></s>
Note that Eq.
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs5" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>(6) only depends on λ, whereby the strategy has a similar behaviour for different wind speeds.</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs6" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The normalised extracted power is plotted in Fig. 2.</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The control strategy is designed to have its stable equilibrium at the peak of the 6 m/s curve and power extraction is thereby optimised at this velocity.</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs7" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>As the power coefficient increases with the wind speed, there is a small shift in the equilibrium tip speed ratio λe towards higher values for increasing wind speeds.</text></s>
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs8" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Fig. 2 shows that this strategy is stable for all rotational velocities at the wind speeds 6 m/s and 12 m/s, while for 3 m/s, the turbine will stop if the tip speed ratio drops below 2.2.</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>At low tip speed ratios, the turbine acceleration is low for all wind speeds due to the close proximity of CP and CPe.</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met11" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>One way to avoid the problem with an unstable region for the 3 m/s curve, and to obtain a faster control strategy, is to introduce a second order term according to(7){Pe*=0ω≤ω0,Pe*=k1ω2(ω-ω0)ω&gt;ω0,where and k1 and ω0 are constants (strategy B).</text></s>
<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs9" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>For the control strategy showed in Fig. 3, k1 and ω0 are chosen so that the turbine starts to absorb power at λ=4 for 3 m/s wind speed and maximum CP is still obtained for 6 m/s.</text></s>
<s sid="63"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>With this modification of the control strategy, the tip speed ratio will be higher at low wind speeds (λe=5.2 at 3 m/s) and lower at high wind speeds (λe=3.7 at 12 m/s) compared to the design value λmax=4.1 at 6 m/s.</text></s>
<s sid="64"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For the 3 m/s and 6 m/s cases, the new strategy has larger differences between extracted and absorbed power for all values below the equilibrium, while for the 12 m/s case, only the region below λ=2 shows larger margins.</text></s>
<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These larger differences in power, combined with a smaller range of rotational velocities, provide a faster control at the expense of steady state operation further away from λmax.</text></s>
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con3" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Note that forcing the turbine to operate at lower tip speed ratio for high wind speeds can be favourable from a structural mechanical point of view as it reduces structural loads.</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met12" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The third case (strategy C), is a mix of the two previous strategies, where strategy A is used in a middle region between ω1 and ω2, and a more rapid change in extracted power is used between ω0 to ω1 and above ω2 up to the rated rotational velocity.</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs10" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>This is accomplished by(8){Pe*=0ω≤ω0,Pe*=k1ω2(ω-ω0)ω0&lt;ω≤ω1,Pe*=k2ω3ω1&lt;ω≤ω2,Pe*=k3ω2(ω-ω2)+k2ω2ω2ω2&lt;ω,where(9)k1=ω1ω1-ω0k2due to continuity.</text></s>

<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod4" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>(8) should be chosen with regard to structural and electrical aspects of the system.</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod5" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Optimal parameter values depend on desired turbine operation where structural, mechanical and electrical considerations are important.</text></s>
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res21" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The equilibrium of strategy C is identical to that of strategy A between 4.5 m/s and 9 m/s, and ω0 is kept to the same value as in strategy B.</text></s>
<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res22" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For simplicity, k1=k3 is chosen, which slightly lowers the tip speed ratio at high wind speeds.</text></s>
<s sid="75"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res23" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The differences between strategies B and C can be seen from a comparison of Figs.</text></s>
3 and 4.
<s sid="76"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res24" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>At low tip speed ratios for 12 m/s, the extracted power of strategy C is somewhat closer to the aerodynamic power, but it has larger margins at tip speed ratios closer to the peak.</text></s>
<s sid="77"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res25" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The decrease in tip speed ratio for the equilibrium is a reasonable design choice since lower rotational velocity reduces the forces on the turbine at high wind speed.</text></s>
<s sid="78"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res26" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The 3 m/s case has its equilibrium at λ=4.9 instead of 5.2, while still having large differences between P and Pe* at low tip speed ratios.</text></s>
<s sid="79"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res27" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>To further illustrate the control strategies at low rotational velocities, the power and torque are plotted against the rotational velocity in Fig. 5 and are compared to the aerodynamic torque for wind speeds of 4.5 m/s and 6 m/s.</text></s>
<s sid="80"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res28" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The equilibria in the power plot illustrate the steady state performance while the speed of the control strategy is directly proportional to the difference in torque.</text></s>
<s sid="81"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res29" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For the 6 m/s equilibrium, the higher slope of strategy B in the torque plot corresponds to a more rapid response of this strategy.</text></s>
<s sid="82"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs13" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Further, the decreased generated torque of strategy C (compared to A) at ω≲1.4 shows the improvements in response times for this strategy at low rotational velocities.</text></s>
<s sid="83"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs14" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>To compare all three strategies for the whole interval between 3 m/s and 12 m/s, the equilibrium tip speed ratio is plotted in Fig. 6, where it is seen that strategy A keeps the tip speed ratio relatively constant, while strategy B has the largest variations.</text></s>
<s sid="84"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res30" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The lower plot in Fig. 6 illustrates the penalty in power production caused by the different control strategies, where the power reduction factor is defined as(10)Pl=CPmax-CP(λe)CPmax.</text></s>

<s sid="86"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res31" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For all schemes, the reduction of captured power is less than 2% for wind speeds above 4 m/s.</text></s>
<s sid="87"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res32" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Strategy C behaves almost as good as strategy A over the major part of the interval, and it should be noted that the loss at 12 m/s is intentional to reduce mechanical loads.</text></s>

Sensitivity analysis
<s sid="90"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met15" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>For each strategy A-C, one parameter is of particular importance for optimisation of the power extraction (k2 for strategies A and C and k1 for strategy B).</text></s>
<s sid="91"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res33" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This parameter is determined from λmax and CPmax, where all strategies in Section 2 are designed for CPmax=0.43 and λmax=4.1.</text></s>
<s sid="92"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res34" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In the present analysis, the power coefficient curves are determined through simulations.</text></s>

<s sid="94"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Therefore, the sensitivity of the control strategies, with respect to errors in λmax and CPmax, needs to be investigated.</text></s>
<s sid="95"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res36" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Errors in λmax will have a stronger effect on the control strategies than errors in CPmax since the relation between rotational velocity and power is cubic, c.f.</text></s>
Eq.

<s sid="99"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res40" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For 3 m/s, the turbine will not run at all with strategy A, as the extracted power is larger than the turbine power.</text></s>
<s sid="100"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res41" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The same strategy should run for 6 m/s and 12 m/s, but with small margins, and the turbine will stop in the 6 m/s case if the tip speed ratio drops below 2.</text></s>

<s sid="240"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con29" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This is presumably not crucial for the validity of the control strategy.</text></s>
<s sid="241"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con30" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The vortex model gives a reasonable power coefficient curve, and a real curve will have a similar shape, even if it peaks at a somewhat different power coefficient.</text></s>
<s sid="242"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con31" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The dynamic stall model in the vortex code cannot handle deep stall accurately.</text></s>
<s sid="243"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con32" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This means that all results at lower tip speed ratios are inaccurate.</text></s>
<s sid="244"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con33" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Experiences from the test setup in Marsta [25] indicate that the actual power coefficient at low tip speed ratios is higher than the simulated values, which increases the stability of the control strategy and should therefore not be an issue for the chosen control strategy.</text></s>
<s sid="245"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con34" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These issues do however mean that the specific parameters for the control system used in this article may not be the best suited parameters for a real turbine.</text></s>
<s sid="246"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con35" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Instead, the actual power coefficient curve should be measured to create a good control strategy.</text></s>
<s sid="247"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con36" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The sensitivity analysis shows that if no measured data exists for the power coefficient curve, a reasonable control strategy can still be created as long as λmax can be calculated with some accuracy, as this is the most important parameter.</text></s>
<s sid="248"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con37" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Once λmax is known, CPmax should be possible to estimate from simulation data combined with data from other similar turbines.</text></s>
<s sid="249"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con38" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>For more stable operation, a too high λmax can be chosen, which causes slightly less power but higher stability.</text></s>
<s sid="250"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con39" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Another simulation issue is that wind speed changes through modified asymptotic wind speed are not a fully realistic model, as the wind speed is changes instantaneously in the entire domain.</text></s>
<s sid="251"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con40" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This approximation should work for slow wind speed changes but be less accurate for rapid changes.</text></s>

<s sid="254"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con43" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Even if the values in oscillating winds are not exact, the trends should still be valid, showing that the control strategies are capable of handling variations in wind speed.</text></s>
<s sid="255"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con44" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The results show that the studied control strategies work if the power coefficient curve has a similar shape as the ones used in the article.</text></s>
<s sid="256"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con45" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>No studies have been performed on a turbine with much higher solidity, which would peak at a lower tip speed ratio, as the simulation tool is not designed for this region.</text></s>

Conclusions
<s sid="258"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con47" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>A simple control system, which only uses the rotational velocity as input, can be sufficient for controlling a vertical axis turbine.</text></s>

<s sid="264"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con53" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The control strategy relies on accurate estimates of CPmax and, even more importantly, λmax.</text></s>
