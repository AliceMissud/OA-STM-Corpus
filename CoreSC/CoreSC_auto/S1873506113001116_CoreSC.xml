Introduction
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that can differentiate into any mature cell type of the body, hold great promise for revolutionizing regenerative medicine.</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Specifically, the integration-free reprogramming technologies, such as ones using plasmids, provide a feasible method to generate autologous and clinical-grade hiPSC lines for therapeutic applications under current good manufacture practice (cGMP) conditions.</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Patient-specific hiPSC lines derived from postnatal somatic cells (Chou et al., 2011; Dowey et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2009) exhibit vast potential not only in disease modeling for pathological studies but also in practical cellular therapies.</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These clinical applications require a large number of hiPSCs or their progenies.</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For example, an optimized dose was suggested to contain 4.2×108 to 5.6×108 CD34+ cells for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation for a 70-kg adult patient (Mehta et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Production of a clinically relevant quantity of hiPSCs and/or their progenies for specific applications, sometimes considered as ~1 to 2billion (Kehoe et al., 2010), in a chemically defined condition by robust, reproducible and economic methods remains a major challenge for advancing hiPSC technology from the bench to the clinic.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Conventionally, hiPSCs are induced and expanded on feeder cells as adherent colonies in media containing sera or serum replacement containing human or animal serum albumin (Okita et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The involvement of animal products or sera impedes these culture conditions to meet the strict requirement of clinical or pre-clinical utilization because of the uncertainty of complex components and the quality variance from batch to batch.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Since the first isolation of hiPSCs, significant improvements in feeder- and serum-free chemically defined culture medium and substrates for adherent hiPSC culture have been developed (Chen et al., 2011; Li et al., 2005; Ludwig et al., 2006; Vallier et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, these approaches involving adherent culture of hiPSCs in Petri dishes still raise a major hurdle of large scale and well-controlled expansion for clinical use.</text></s>

<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>After a Rho-associated-coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y27632 was reported to permit the survival of dissociated hESCs when supplemented in the medium only on the first day of seeding (Watanabe et al., 2007), detailed protocols were established for the single-cell inoculation and suspension culture of hPSCs as cell aggregates in a variety of vessel types (Amit et al., 2011; Olmer et al., 2010; Zweigerdt et al., 2011).</text></s>

<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Despite the rapid development of hPSC suspension culture in these studies, most of the reproducible systems are based on commercially available serum-free media, StemPro or mTeSR, which are complex and expensive.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The unknown composition (such as StemPro) and high cost of these media pose a major concern for developing reproducible methods for large-scale expansion of hiPSCs.</text></s>

<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We did confirm that this significantly improved medium without the need to add bovine serum albumin (BSA) Fraction V or human albumin supported the growth of multiple hiPSC lines under feeder-free conditions in adhesion.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Based on this, we sought to test whether the significantly simplified E8 medium could support a robust and economic suspension culture system in a stirred bioreactor for large-scale expansion and cryopreservation of hiPSCs.</text></s>
