Introduction
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>As the northern mid-latitudes of Uranus emerged from a long dark winter in the late 1990s, bright cloud features began to appear in near-IR images, unlike any that had been seen in the southern hemisphere.</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In 1997, using the recently commissioned HST NICMOS camera, Karkoschka (1998) found several bright clouds near the northern limb of Uranus.</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The local contrast of these features reached a maximum near 190% at 1.7μm, and the fractional integrated differential brightness (FIDB), which is the total extra light reflected by one of these clouds as a fraction of the total light reflected by the planet, reached about 1.2%.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This was followed by the Sromovsky et al. (2000) detection of even brighter cloud features in 1998 and 1999 groundbased images obtained with the NASA IRTF NSFCAM imager.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>One of these features, located at a latitude of 30°±6°N, reached a local contrast of ∼500% (in deconvolved images) and an FIDB of 4.9±0.7% using the Spencer 1.73-μm filter.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The brightest single cloud feature ever observed on Uranus was found 6years later by Sromovsky et al. (2007) in 14-15 August 2005 Keck II images obtained with the NIRC2 camera and adaptive optics system.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This feature (the brightest feature in Fig. 1B) reached an FIDB value of 4-5% in the H filter and ∼13% in the K′ filter.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res21" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The high brightness was short lived, however.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res22" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In images taken on 6 July (before the peak) and on 29 October (more than two months later) the feature was a factor of 4-10times dimmer.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Another especially interesting transient feature was found at nearly the same latitude in 2004 images (Sromovsky and Fry, 2005), but in this case the bright clouds formed a huge complex extending across almost 90° of longitude (Fig. 1A).</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res23" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These transient but very bright cloud features in the northern hemisphere of Uranus were seen in both H and K′ filters, the latter implying that the features were elevated to relatively high altitudes, placing significant amounts of aerosol scattering above the background of methane and hydrogen absorption.</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These features reached pressures in the 300-500mb range (Sromovsky et al., 2007), which is well above the 1.2-bar methane condensation level (Sromovsky et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj1" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>These eruptions of bright cloud material are thus almost certainly composed largely of methane ice, perhaps as pure particles or as methane ice coatings on particles originally condensed at deeper levels and then lofted above the methane condensation level.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res24" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These bright cloud features might possibly be due to deep convective events, qualitatively similar to thunderstorms on Jupiter.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>A more likely explanation, however, is that such features are generated by vertical displacements of atmosphere flowing around vortex circulations, resulting in local condensation as the flow is displaced above the methane condensation level.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Bright cloud features associated with Neptune's Great Dark Spot were termed companion clouds because they traveled along with it in defiance of the meridional shear of the local zonal wind profile (Hammel et al. (1989)).</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Such clouds are thought to be similar to orographic clouds generated by lee waves downwind of mountain ranges, an idea first suggested by Smith et al., 1989 and later verified by dynamical models in which vortex circulations produced similar cloud features (Stratman et al., 2001).</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Companion clouds were also found to be associated with the first dark spot ever seen on Uranus (Hammel et al., 2009), which was also found at northern mid-latitudes in July 2006.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs3" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The dark spot itself was near 28°N planetocentric latitude, while bright companion clouds were seen over a latitude range of 3° centered about 29°N.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res25" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Companion clouds related to this dark spot were also seen in H images obtained with the Keck II telescope NIRC2 Narrow Angle (NA) camera (Fig. 1C), though they were not unusually bright in these images.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res26" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A similar configuration of even brighter clouds was observed in 2007 (Fig. 1D), also thought to be associated with a dark oval circulation feature (Sromovsky et al., 2009), although the evidence is not as strong in this case.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The cause of these sudden increases in high altitude cloud development is unknown, and whether they are all related to vortex circulation features is likewise unknown.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Thus, further examples that can be studied in detail offer the possibility of gaining a better understanding of this phenomenon.</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj2" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>On 26 October 2011, Gemini images of Uranus revealed another unusually bright cloud feature (Fig. 2C), providing us with another possible opportunity to study this episodic development.</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>We also located these features in a set of Hubble images taken to support an investigation of the planet's rings (M.</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa3" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Showalter, PI) on 13 October and 23 October 2011 using the F845M filter.</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res27" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These images (Fig. 2A and B) revealed that the cloud feature had brightened and impelled us to further investigation.</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res28" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In the following, we describe the observations obtained in pursuit of this feature, the motions we determined from them, the morphological changes that occurred, the nature of a second bright spot discovered at nearly the same latitude, the predicted close approach of the two features, their brightness changes over time, the Target of Opportunity imaging results, constraints on their vertical structure, and our conclusions.</text></s>
Observations
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>From the &quot;discovery&quot; observation on 26 October 2011, we worked backward and forward to locate other observations of the bright spot we here refer to as BS1.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj4" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Observations were gathered from HST, Keck II, Gemini-North, the VLT, and from Pic du Midi.</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj5" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>After the November 2011 Keck II observations identified a second bright spot (here designated BS2) at nearly the same latitude as BS1, we also examined the extant data to identify additional observations of this second feature.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs4" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>All the imaging observations we used for feature tracking from the large telescopes are summarized in observing time sequence in Table 1.</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs5" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The images we used for estimating cloud height are listed in Table 2.</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs6" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>A complete list of the HST imaging observations that were part of the TOO program is provided in Table 3.</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs7" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The camera characteristics for each observing configuration are given in Table 4 and filter throughputs are displayed in Fig. 3 above a plot of the spectral penetration depth of sunlight into Uranus' atmosphere.</text></s>
Morphology and position measurements
Morphology
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs8" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>There was considerable temporal variation in the morphology of both bright spots, as illustrated in Fig. 4.</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs9" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The rectangular projections in that figure are mostly from H-filter images and generally enhanced to show morphology rather than relative changes in brightness.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res29" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>An exception is the pair of F845M images (Fig. 4D and E) which are enhanced in the same way, so that in this case the apparent brightness increase from 13 to 23 October is meaningful and amounts to a 30% increase in FIDB.</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs10" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>When first identified in the 26 October 2011 Gemini-North image (Fig. 4F), the bright spot (BS1) appeared as a relatively compact feature with two adjacent components.</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs11" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Between 13 and 23 October, the feature became more compact as well as brighter, but then expanded in area by 26 October.</text></s>
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res30" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Its very compact appearance on 19 September (Fig. 4C) is probably a result of the 1.764-μm filter used for that image.</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res31" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>As indicated in Fig. 3, this filter does not penetrate as deeply as the H filter and thus weights the higher part of the cloud more heavily, which seems to be more compact than the deeper structure.</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res32" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The apparent expansion of the cloud area seen in the 10-11 November images (Fig. 4G and H) is mainly a result of a temporary misalignment of the adaptive optics lenslet array, which produced an extended and oddly shaped PSF when extended objects were used as a wavefront reference.</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res33" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This misalignment had the effect of producing a secondary image displaced in the x direction from the primary image.</text></s>
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met1" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>However, some of the expansion of the BS1 image is likely to be real, based on its subsequent appearance as a multi-element structure in the 13 November image (panel I), which was taken after the AO misalignment was fixed.</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs12" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>This image shows several very compact features distributed over a somewhat wider area than previously seen.</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs13" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The 16 December image (panel J) shows a very small feature and an overall fading of BS1, which we verified by brightness measurements described in the next section.</text></s>
<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs14" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The brightness continued to decline so much that it became quite difficult to locate BS1 in any later F845M images (see Section 7).</text></s>
<s sid="63"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs15" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Panels K-M are centered within the 15° range of where we expected BS1 to be, but except for panel L, which we think is dominated by BS2, there is no obvious bright feature to be found.</text></s>
<s sid="64"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs16" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>On the other hand there are hints of BS1, better seen in FQ889N images (see Section 7), where there is a low contrast streak near the center of panel K and a bright spot just left of center in panel M.</text></s>
<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs17" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The F845M image in panel M also registers that bright feature and also a faint dark spot just below it.</text></s>
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs18" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>We did not become aware of the second bright spot (BS2) until we saw the 10 November image (Fig. 4P).</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs19" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>It seemed to be at nearly the same latitude, but drifted relative to BS1 at a rate of nearly 8°/day (compare panels G and H or P and Q).</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res34" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We then looked for it in previous observations and did find it in all of the H-band images taken when BS2 was on the sunlit side of the planet.</text></s>
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res35" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The relative motions, close approach, and relative expansion seen in both features in the November images, suggested the possibility of interactions between the two features.</text></s>
<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res36" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This might take the form of increased vertical disturbances and condensation cloud formation, an idea suggested by such an occurrence on Saturn in 1981, as shown in Fig. 4 of Sromovsky et al. (1983).</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs20" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Morphological variations in BS2 are displayed in Fig. 4N-V, from 27 July 2011 to 29 December 2011.</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res37" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>There is some doubt about the July observation because of the long gap from then until its next sighting on 25 October, and because it appears at a considerably higher latitude in the earlier observation.</text></s>
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res38" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, latitudinal variations are not uncommon for Uranian cloud features.</text></s>
<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res39" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The most unusual morphological change associated with BS2 occurred during the December sequence of observations, when a small dark spot was revealed in 20-29 December images, with maximum contrast occurring on 25 December (Fig. 4U).</text></s>
<s sid="75"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res40" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This is only the second dark spot ever seen on Uranus.</text></s>
Position measurements and modeling
Large telescope results
<s sid="76"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The morphological variations during the period over which the spots were tracked made the measurement of their positions somewhat of a challenge.</text></s>
<s sid="77"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>To define their positions we used two different methods: (1) the location of the center of differential brightness (CODB) and (2) the location of the brightest pixel.</text></s>
<s sid="78"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In the first method we weight the position of each pixel inside a box containing the feature by the differential brightness above the image background.</text></s>
<s sid="79"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod1" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The coordinates of the CODB are mathematically defined as follows:(1)xCODB=∑i,jtargetxi·[I(i,j)-IB(i,j)]∑i,jtarget[I(i,j)-IB(i,j)](2)yCODB=∑i,jtargetyi·[I(i,j)-IB(i,j)]∑i,jtarget[I(i,j)-IB(i,j)]where I(i,j) is the reflectivity at image location i, j, IB(i,j) is the background reflectivity at the perimeter of the target box interpolated to the i, j position, xi and yj are the physical coordinates associated with the indexed pixel coordinates, and the summation is over the area of the target box.</text></s>
<s sid="80"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs21" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The CODB position measurements are summarized in Table 5.</text></s>
<s sid="81"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs22" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The uncertainties in establishing a position value are relatively low for each individual image, but the position of the suspected underlying circulation feature that generates the cloud features is far less certain, and probably better estimated from the variability in latitude values from different images and longitude deviations from a constant drift rate model.</text></s>
<s sid="82"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs23" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The CODB positions are less variable than peak locations, although the variability is only significant for latitude measurements to be discussed later.</text></s>
<s sid="83"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs24" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The CODB results for longitude are displayed in Fig. 5 for BS1 and in Fig. 6 for BS2.</text></s>
<s sid="84"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res41" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Initially it appeared that BS1 was drifting at a constant drift rate, but subsequent observations revealed a more complex behavior.</text></s>
<s sid="85"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs25" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Constant drift model fit results are summarized in Table 6 for several different time periods.</text></s>
<s sid="86"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res42" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>While the average rates are very precisely defined, the instantaneous drift rates are much more uncertain because they vary with time.</text></s>
<s sid="87"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res43" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>After 26 October, the BS1 feature increased its westward drift rate in comparison to the average observed between July and October.</text></s>
<s sid="88"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res44" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The average drift rate for the 26 July to 16 December period was 1.386°W/day, which is nearly the same as the drift rate seen for the 26 July to 26 October period.</text></s>
<s sid="89"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res45" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>But, from 10 November to 16 December the drift rate increased to 1.749°W/day, raising serious doubts about our ability to predict its position during the planned Target of Opportunity imaging by Hubble.</text></s>
<s sid="90"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res46" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The residuals for the July-December fit raise the possibility of a long-period (∼150-day) oscillation in drift rate.</text></s>
<s sid="91"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res47" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It is also conceivable that the drift rate was perturbed by interactions with the second bright spot (discussed in the next section).</text></s>
<s sid="92"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res48" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Although we were initially unsure of which spot was seen in the 20 December HST image, its longitude deviates roughly 30° from the expected location of BS1, while it almost exactly matches the predicted location of BS2.</text></s>
<s sid="93"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res49" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The decline of BS1 in combination with the inherently lower contrast in FQ845M images compared to H images may both be responsible for its near disappearance on 19 December.</text></s>
<s sid="94"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res50" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The only hint of its location is a faint streak in the FQ889N image (see Section 7), which we used to estimate its position at that time.</text></s>
<s sid="95"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res51" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>As shown in Fig. 6, the location of the bright spot observed on 20 December 2011 is in good agreement with the position predicted from the linear drift models for BS2.</text></s>
<s sid="96"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res52" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>When that and the 25 December observation are included in a fit to observations from 27 July through 25 December, we obtain a drift rate of 9.125°W/day, which is 7.739°W/day faster than BS1.</text></s>
<s sid="97"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res53" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The spot drift rates are only roughly compatible with the mean zonal wind profile at their respective latitudes, which are compared in Fig. 7.</text></s>
<s sid="98"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res54" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>One way to interpret the substantial deviations from the zonal mean profile is that there are unseen vortices (V1 and V2 in Fig. 7) centered at the latitudes defined by the intersections of the drift rates and the wind profile curve.</text></s>
<s sid="99"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res55" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>If that interpretation were valid, then the BS1 bright spot appears on average to be located a few degrees north of its generating vortex (V1), while the average BS2 cloud material is located a few degrees south of its (different) generating vortex (V2).</text></s>
<s sid="100"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, we will later see that BS2 clouds may appear at different locations relative to its associated dark spot (a possible vortex marker).</text></s>
<s sid="101"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Another possible interpretation for the deviations from the zonal wind profile is that the BS1 is drifting more slowly than the mean profile because it is at a higher altitude than the mean of cloud features used to establish the zonal wind profile, and that BS2 is drifting more rapidly because it is a deeper feature.</text></s>
<s sid="102"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con3" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This makes qualitative sense because Voyager IRIS observations of Uranus (Flasar et al., 1987) imply that winds generally decay with height, although the quantitative estimates for the 500-1000mb region are only 2-5m/s per scale height at 25-30°N.</text></s>
<s sid="103"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>To explain the 40m/s net BS1 and BS2 deviations from the zonal mean profile as effects of vertical wind shear would require at least 8 scale heights of vertical separation.</text></s>
<s sid="104"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>As we shall see later, the measured cloud height difference is only ∼500mb, which is less than one scale height.</text></s>

<s sid="224"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res143" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>From Fig. 12 it can be inferred that this feature would also have been visible in K′ images, had any been taken at the time.</text></s>

Summary and conclusions
<s sid="243"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Our main conclusions are as follows:1.</text></s>
<s sid="244"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>On 26 November 2011 we discovered a new bright spot on Uranus near 25°N (named BS1) that grew increasingly bright near the time of discovery, suggesting a possible major brightening might be underway, perhaps competing with previous features observed in 1999, 2004, and 2005.</text></s>
2.
<s sid="245"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res155" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>With the help of observations from Gemini-North, Keck, Pic du Midi, and HST observatories, some before and some after the discovery date, we were able to track BS1 from 26 July through 16 December, and found it to be drifting at nearly a constant rate of 1.386°/day westward at a mean latitude of 24.3° planetocentric until 13 November, after which its drift rate increased to 1.749°/day westward.</text></s>
3.
<s sid="246"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res156" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We discovered a second bright spot (named BS2) on November 10, when it was very close to BS1.</text></s>
<s sid="247"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res157" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This second spot was tracked from 27 July until at least 20 December, although with larger time gaps because it was not found in the October HST images.</text></s>
<s sid="248"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res158" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>BS2 was found to have a mean latitude of 25.5° and a mean drift rate of 9.125°/day westward from 27 July 2011 through 16 December 2011, increasing to 9.235°/day westward for the November-December time period.</text></s>
4.
<s sid="249"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res159" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>From spectral modulation ratios in H and Hcont image pairs obtained in July, October, and November, we inferred that BS1 was a higher altitude feature than BS2, with inferred pressures mainly in the 350-600 mb range for BS1 and mainly in the 1-1.3bar range for BS2, explaining why BS2 was never seen in any K′ image over that period.</text></s>
<s sid="250"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res160" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The vertical separation does not seem large enough to explain their relative deviations from the drift rate expected from the most recent zonal wind profile obtained from fits to 2007 cloud tracking results.</text></s>
5.
<s sid="251"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res161" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Because BS1 and BS2 differed in mean latitudes by only 1.6° and had drift rates differing by 7.7°/day, there was a possibility of interaction between these features at 46.5-day intervals, with one of the close approaches occurring on 8 November 2011, shortly after which there was a large expansion in horizontal size of the features, and another close approach occurring on 25 December 2011.</text></s>
<s sid="252"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Capturing the results of this possible interaction was the aim of the TOO imaging carried out on 20, 25, and 29 December 2011.</text></s>
6.
<s sid="253"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The large drift rate difference between BS1 and BS2 (7.7°/day) in comparison with the difference expected from the latitudinal shear in the zonal wind profile (1.5°/day) is quite large, and might be due to these features actually being companions to unseen vortices at somewhat different and more widely separated latitudes that do follow the zonal flow.</text></s>
7.
<s sid="254"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res162" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>BS1 began to decline in brightness between October 26 and November 10, and was not clearly identifiable after 16 December, though subtle features were found that are consistent with survival through our last image on 29 December 2011, in which BS1 appears just north of a faint dark spot visible in F845M images, and has much more contrast in the F889N image taken on that date.</text></s>
8.
<s sid="255"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res163" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The variable drift rates of both BS1 and BS2 suggest the possibility of long period oscillations in drift rates and latitudes, although latitudinal variability of the bright features is too large to confirm a simple advective model in which drift rate is proportional to latitude.</text></s>
9.
<s sid="256"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res164" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>BS2 was identifiable in 20 and 29 December TOO images, and in the 25 December image the feature seen may be either BS2 or the result of merging of BS1 and BS2.</text></s>
<s sid="257"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res165" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In the 20 and 29 December images BS2 is found adjacent to a faint dark spot, which is plausibly a marker for the putative vortex circulation that might be producing the bright cloud features.</text></s>
10.
<s sid="258"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res166" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The main feature visible in the 25 December image is a small dark spot accompanied by a bright companion cloud.</text></s>
<s sid="259"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res167" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The dark spot is visible in F845M and F775W images and the companion cloud is visible in these images and also with greater contrast in FQ889N and FQ906N images, implying that the bright cloud is elevated well above the methane condensation level.</text></s>
11.
<s sid="260"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs46" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The observed peak in the fractional integrated differential brightness of BS1 in the H filter was observed to be 0.64% in the discovery image on 26 October 2011, and declined to 0.02% by December 16.</text></s>
12.
<s sid="261"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs47" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The observed peak in the fractional integrated differential brightness of BS2 in the H filter was observed to be 0.13% on 11 November 2011, declined to 0.003% by 16 December, and appears to have risen to 0.03% by 25 December.</text></s>
13.
<s sid="262"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con19" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The small dark spot observed in late December has the greatest contrast at 0.7-0.8μm, while Neptune's dark spots have the highest contrast at 0.4-0.6μm, suggesting a different formation mechanism or difference in vertical structure that remains to be understood.</text></s>
