Introduction
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Transthyretin (TTR) is a β-sheet-rich protein that is mainly synthesized by the liver (Buxbaum and Reixach, 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>TTR normally serves as a plasma transport protein for thyroid hormone and retinol-binding protein with vitamin A (Kanai et al., 1968).</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Mutant forms of TTR, however, cause familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP), which is the most common type of autosomal-dominant hereditary systemic amyloidosis (Saraiva et al., 1983; Ando et al., 2005).</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>As of today, more than 100 different points of mutation and a deletion in the TTR gene have been reported (Westermark et al., 2002; Ando and Ueda, 2012; Benson and Kincaid, 2007), with the Val30Met mutation being the most common.</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Systemic amyloid depositions in FAP cause various symptoms, including cardiac and renal dysfunctions, gastrointestinal disorders, glandular and autonomic dysfunctions, and peripheral neuropathy (Ando and Suhr, 1998; Ando et al., 1993, 1997; Araki, 1984).</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Because the liver synthesizes most of the TTR in the serum, liver transplantation (LT) is the only treatment available to halt the progression of FAP (Ando et al., 1995a; Suhr et al., 1995).</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Although LT is widely accepted as the only lifesaving treatment option for FAP patients (Ando et al., 1995b), LT involves several problems, such as a shortage of liver donors, the effects of immunosuppressants, and the progression of ocular disorders caused by a continuing production of amyloidogenic TTR (ATTR) by the retina (Ong et al., 1994; Kawaji et al., 2005).</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot3" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Despite an urgent need to develop alternatives to LT, details about the mechanism of amyloid formation in FAP are still unknown.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Although attempts were made to establish experimental models of FAP, a suitable tool is not yet available (Buxbaum et al., 2003; Pokrzywa et al., 2007; Berg et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Because FAP is an autosomal-dominant inherited disease, TTR secreted into plasma is the heterotetrameric mixture of wild-type TTR and variant TTR.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, all TTRs used in experiments have been homotetramers, and an artificial Val30Met-overexpressed cell system does not fully represent the relevant processes in patients with FAP (Sousa et al., 2000; Cardoso et al., 2008; Sato et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot4" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Therefore, an urgent need exists to establish an experimental model such as heterozygous ATTR mutant cells derived from FAP patients.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have an unlimited replicative ability and the potential to differentiate into most cell types in organisms (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006; Takahashi et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot5" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>The creation of iPS cells has permitted the development of patient-specific pluripotent cells and has led to useful models of human diseases (Saha and Jaenisch, 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Recent studies reported success in generating patient-specific iPS cells for various diseases including neurologic (Dimos et al., 2008; Ebert et al., 2009; Soldner et al., 2009), hematologic (Raya et al., 2009), and metabolic disorders (Maehr et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>A report on spinal muscular atrophy-specific iPS cells suggested applications to disease modeling and drug screening by showing the disease-specific changes in cell survival and function (Ebert et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac19" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>A report on Fanconi anemia-specific iPS cells also indicated a potential value for cell therapy by correcting the genetic defect before iPS cell derivation (Raya et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot6" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Thus, although disease-specific iPS cells may help therapeutic research, iPS cells from patients with FAP have not yet been generated.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met1" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In this study, we first report the generation of iPS cells from patients with FAP ATTR Val30Met, which we achieved by reprogramming their fibroblasts with a mixture of Sendai virus (SeV) vector, which does not integrate into the host genome (Li et al., 2000) and has a low risk of tumorigenicity, encoding four transcription factors: octamer 3/4 (Oct3/4), sex-determining region Y box 2 (Sox2), Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), and c-Myc (Fusaki et al., 2009; Ban et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac20" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>FAP-specific iPS cells indeed differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells (Shiraki et al., 2008; Shiraki et al., 2011) and expressed Val30Met ATTR.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp1" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>FAP-specific iPS cells may thus provide valuable experimental tools to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of FAP with a potential value for cell therapy applications.</text></s>

<s sid="147"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>FAP-specific iPS cells had the potential to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells, a major TTR-producing cell, and indeed expressed ATTR Val30Met and wild-type TTR protein.</text></s>
<s sid="148"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>FAP-specific iPS cells demonstrated the possibility of serving as a pathological tool, which may contribute to elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of FAP and developing novel therapeutic strategies for FAP.</text></s>
<s sid="149"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac21" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Attempts to establish the experimental models of FAP (Buxbaum et al., 2003; Pokrzywa et al., 2007; Berg et al., 2009) have not been as successful as researchers would wish.</text></s>
<s sid="150"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac22" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>It has been reported that transgenic mice overexpressing mutated TTR did not display signs of neuropathology (Buxbaum et al., 2003).</text></s>
<s sid="151"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac23" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>It is still controversial whether the pathogenic mechanism of FAP in Drosophila model is in the same manner as human (Pokrzywa et al., 2007; Berg et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="152"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac24" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In addition, a review of previous studies about the molecular pathogenesis of FAP indicates that most of the studies investigated the pathologic effect of ATTR using non-mutant cells or an artificial high expression system (Sousa et al., 2000; Cardoso et al., 2008; Sato et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="153"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac25" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Indeed, the neurodegeneration induced by ATTR or endoplasmic reticulum quality control of ATTR was studied with non-mutant mammalian cells transfected with the receptor for advanced glycation end products (Sousa et al., 2000) or wild-type TTR and ATTR (Sato et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="154"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con6" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Because FAP is an autosomal-dominant hereditary disease and those systems did not utilize heterozygous ATTR mutant cell models, those systems do not fully represent the relevant processes in patients with FAP and are unsuitable for evaluation of therapy.</text></s>
<s sid="155"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con7" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The ratio of expression of TTR protein to ATTR protein varies among cells.</text></s>
<s sid="156"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con8" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>As with iPS cells designed to be specific for other diseases, iPS cells generated from patients who were heterozygous for FAP are more useful for elucidating the pathogenesis of FAP: TTR and ATTR in heterozygous FAP form heterotetramers, which produce amyloid, and recombinant TTR forms a homotetramer, which is a totally different form of TTR in plasma and tissues.</text></s>

<s sid="158"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con10" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In this study, hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from FAP-specific iPS cells indeed secreted TTR and ATTR protein in the ratio of almost 1 to 1 as heterozygous ATTR mutant cells (Fig. 5B).</text></s>
<s sid="159"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The amount of TTR protein was approximately 2.28μg/ml (Fig. 4C), which is comparable with the previous result (0.2-2μg/ml) in functional hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from normal iPS cells (Sullivan et al., 2010), and exhibits 50 times higher than the previous result (0.034-0.057μg/ml) in human hepatocytes in primary culture (Wigmore et al., 1997).</text></s>
<s sid="160"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac26" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Moreover, differentiation of the same FAP-specific iPS cell line into various cells such as neurons and cardiomyocytes may aid understanding of the tissue selectivity of amyloidosis, which differs according to variants (Hammarstrom et al., 2003; Sekijima et al., 2003; Yamashita et al., 2005).</text></s>

<s sid="164"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con14" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In this study, we took full advantage of the special characteristics of this SeV vector to establish FAP-specific iPS cells.</text></s>
<s sid="165"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Because SeV vectors replicate only in the cytoplasm of infected cells and do not integrate into the host genome (Li et al., 2000), no risk of modifying the host genome exists.</text></s>
<s sid="166"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac27" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Using retrovirus or lentivirus vectors results in integration of viral transgenes into the host genome, which includes a risk of tumorigenicity (Hussein et al., 2011; Gore et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="167"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac28" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>To solve this problem, plasmids (Okita et al., 2008), a Cre/loxP system (Soldner et al., 2009), adenoviruses (Stadtfeld et al., 2008), piggyback (Woltjen et al., 2009), a minicircle vector (Jia et al., 2010), and proteins (Zhou et al., 2009) have been developed.</text></s>
<s sid="168"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The risk of integration into the genome still remains, however, for DNA-type vectors (Harui et al., 1999), and those methods also demonstrated low induction efficiency.</text></s>
<s sid="169"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thus, the SeV vector that we used is believed to have a significant advantage compared with available methods because of its safety, efficiency, and convenience.</text></s>
<s sid="170"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>SeV vectors are slowly diluted and disappear during iPS cell division, and SeV vector-positive cells can be removed by means of an anti-SeV-HN antibody (Fusaki et al., 2009).</text></s>
