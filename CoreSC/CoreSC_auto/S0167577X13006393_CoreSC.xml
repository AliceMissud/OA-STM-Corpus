<s sid="117"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con8" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Since XPS is a surface chemical analysis technique (with analysis depth less than 10nm), this suggests that the nanoparticles lying at the surface of the fibres were embedded in a thin layer of polymer.</text></s>

<s sid="121"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res53" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The slightly lower percentage of oxygen in CaP fibres, compared to the HA nanopowder, may result from the loss of OH groups (dehydroxylation) that occur at high temperature.</text></s>

<s sid="125"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res56" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It could not be seen by FTIR either, since the band characteristic of 3OH was observed below 400cm-1 which is below the range explored in this study.</text></s>
<s sid="126"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res57" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Systems containing both HA and TCP phases have been intensively investigated and have shown potential for bone tissue engineering [26,27].</text></s>
<s sid="127"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con13" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>β-TCP has exceptionally good tissue compatibility, allowing direct bonding between the regenerated and the native bone without intermediate connective tissue, and encouraging faster bone regeneration and resorbability than HA.</text></s>

<s sid="130"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Measurements of mechanical robustness of the CaP fibres remain to be conducted, but initial inspection has indicated profound scaffold fragility compared to the PLGA-HA composites.</text></s>
<s sid="131"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Although the polymer-based fibres are more flexible and less fragile, the absence of polymer matrix may be preferred for applications such as bone tissue engineering and drug delivery.</text></s>

Conclusions
<s sid="135"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con21" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>To conclude, the results presented in this paper have demonstrated that CaP fibres can be prepared by electrospinning a PLGA-HA composite solution and subsequently applying a thermal treatment at sintering temperature to the electrospun fibres.</text></s>
<s sid="136"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res58" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The polymer phase was evaporated at the high temperatures while the nanoparticles were sintered, allowing the samples to retain their submicrofibrous morphology.</text></s>
<s sid="137"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res59" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Hydroxyapatite was identified to be the main phase in the treated samples.</text></s>
<s sid="138"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res60" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Tricalcium phosphates were also found, as a result of the dehydroxylation and decomposition of deficient HA at high temperature.</text></s>
<s sid="139"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The chemistry of the new fibres holds great potential for bone tissue engineering.</text></s>
<s sid="140"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, more investigations are to be carried out, in particular to improve their mechanical properties, as these are currently insufficient for the fibres to be used as bone scaffold.</text></s>
<s sid="141"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Nevertheless, this simple approach is promising for the creation of submicrofibres made of a wide variety of ceramic materials without the use of toxic and expensive chemical precursors.</text></s>
