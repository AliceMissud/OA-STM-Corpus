Introduction

<s sid="6"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The quality of discrete particle (nanoparticle) dispersion, which characterises the uniformity in spread of the particles through the material (i.e. whether the particles are ordered, random or clustered) can affect the material properties [1].</text></s>
<s sid="7"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>It is time-consuming and expensive to obtain micrographs of a composite material, and so only a few images are available for analysis.</text></s>
<s sid="8"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Hence robust quantitative analysis must be performed on the available micrographs to obtain an objective measurement of dispersion.</text></s>
<s sid="9"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The measurement of nanoparticle dispersion is rapidly advancing [2-5].</text></s>
<s sid="10"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Ideally these techniques would be applied universally to any type of nanocomposite or particulate-reinforced material.</text></s>
<s sid="11"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res4" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These require a comparison against a known reference system, where typically the particles are either perfectly or randomly dispersed.</text></s>
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Inappropriate idealisation of both the quality of the data and the particle morphology (i.e. the particle shape) leads to inaccurate conclusions.</text></s>
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Nonetheless many analyses assume that theories where the particles are point-like (i.e. having no volume or shape) are valid.</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Thus a major hindrance is that it is not well understood how the morphological (shape) properties of the nanoparticles affect these parameters.</text></s>
Morphology of nanoparticles
Types of nanomaterials
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Within a particular material there can be a significant variation of the nanoparticles' size, aspect ratio and regularity of shape.</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Thus it is useful to consider some of the nanoparticles used in existing materials.</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Many nanoparticles can be manufactured with a low aspect ratio (defined as the major axis length divided by the minor axis length such that a sphere has an aspect ratio of 1).</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Ceramic nanoparticles (e.g. silica, titania and alumina) can be readily produced with diameters of 3-300nm, e.g.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>[6], but these often have an irregular surface [7].</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Core-shell particles with a 100-300nm diameter rubbery core and a hard shell are often used for toughening of thermoset polymers, e.g.</text></s>
[8].
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod1" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Rubber particles can also be produced via phase-separation of initially soluble rubbers during curing of thermoset polymer matrices, and spherical particles with diameters between 40nm [9] and 200μm [10] can be achieved, as reviewed by Bagheri et al. [11].</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, poly-dispersity of the particle size cannot be neglected in these materials, as the formation of the carboxyl-terminated butadiene acrylonitrile (CTBN) rubber particles leads to large size variations.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For example, Hsieh et al. [7] measured a mean diameter of 0.54μm, but with a standard deviation of 0.27 times the mean value.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Conventional plate-like particles are generally irregularly shaped; particles such as muscovite mica are typically used with an average diameter between 10 and 80μm [12] and a thickness of a few microns.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Nanoclays (e.g. montmorillonite or hectorite) are layered silicates with a structure of stacked platelets which can be exfoliated to give platelets approximately 1nm thick with lateral dimensions that can vary from 30nm to tens of microns [13].</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Research on graphene is very active at present, and platelets one atom thick with linear dimensions potentially in the order of millimetres are achievable, although smaller aspect ratios with linear dimensions of tens of microns would be expected for use in particulate composites [14].</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Particles can become very elongated, the extreme case being carbon fibres which are microns in diameter and can be kilometres long.</text></s>

<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Carbon nanotubes and silica nanowires can also have very high aspect ratios.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Single-walled nanotube diameters range from 0.4 to 5.6nm with a maximum length of several millimetres, while for multiwalled nanotubes the diameter is from several to hundreds of nanometres, with lengths up to the centimetre range [16].</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For multiwalled nanotubes, a length of 140μm and a diameter of 120nm is typical [17], giving an aspect ratio of about 100.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Nanowires have been fabricated with lengths of 110mm and diameters as small as 60nm, giving an aspect ratio of around 3700 [18].</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp1" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>However, shorter lengths and hence smaller aspect ratios would again be expected for use in particulate composites.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp2" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>It would clearly be inappropriate to approximate particles with such high aspect ratios as point-like, i.e. having no size or shape.</text></s>

Parametrizing dispersion
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod6" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Our chosen quantitative parameter for spatial dispersion is the Area Disorder of Delaunay tessellation (ADDel), which we previously showed gave a reliable measure of the system's spatial dispersion [5,22].</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod7" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The Area Disorder is a function of the coefficients of variation of the Delaunay triangle's area (A) and is calculated using(1)ADDel=(A¯/σA+1)-1,where A¯ and σA are the mean and standard deviation of A, respectively [22].</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs5" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>ADDel measures the global regularity of the particle arrangement within the system.</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs6" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The larger the value (where 0⩽ ADDel⩽1), the more clustered the system is.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs7" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>ADDel is chosen to be invariant to the number density of particles present.</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod8" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The dispersion of a material is interpreted by comparing the measured ADDel against the expected value for a randomly arranged set of particles, i.e. it is compared to a reference model.</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod9" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>If the material is statistically equal to or more regular than a model of random particles then it is taken to be well-dispersed.</text></s>
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod10" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Otherwise, if the material is more clustered than the random model it is taken to be poorly-dispersed.</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>It is this part of the analysis where the morphological properties of the particles become a concern.</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Specifically, they affect the description of randomly arranged, by which we actually mean that particles have no preference to where they are found (i.e. there is neither attraction nor repulsion between particles), other than lying outside the exclusion areas set up by the macroscopic size of the particles.</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Thus sets of nanoparticles with different morphological details can have the same dispersion quality but be structurally arranged differently.</text></s>
Reference models
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A hard-core particle model can be used to represent the nanoparticles by their centre of mass positions.</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These points are arranged such that they do not occupy the same space, as governed by the nanoparticles' physical size.</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>A major detraction of handling hard-core considerations is that they are complicated by the form of the particles, which is a combination of the particle sizes, shapes and orientations.</text></s>
<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con3" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Simplifying particles to centre of mass points may be tempting, particularly as much is known about the spatial statistical behaviour of uninhibited points.</text></s>
<s sid="63"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However this simplification can lead to discrepancies in the interpretation compared to other measurements that consider the particle surface [23].</text></s>
<s sid="64"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp3" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>For these models to be valid we assume that the material has no spatial gradients (i.e. the material has the same statistics anywhere within it) such that a sample micrograph of the material is truly representative of the whole.</text></s>
Size and shape
<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The effect of nanoparticle size on dispersion was previously studied using identical spherical particles [22].</text></s>
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>By increasing the area fraction (coverage) of particles, the system appeared more regular, due to an enforced minimum separation distance (i.e. the particle diameter) and accordingly the Area Disorder would reduce.</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod11" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Variation of particle sizes is introduced into micrographs from several sources, these include: (1) the non-identical manufacturing of nanoparticles; (2) stereological effects within the micrograph (e.g. the projection of nanoparticles); and (3) an intentional manufacturing of dissimilar sized nanoparticles (i.e. bi-disperse population).</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod12" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>To investigate the role that the individual particle morphology (size, shape) has on dispersion we model randomly disordered materials containing: (1) non-identical hard-core particles, with a size distribution and (2) non-circular ellipsoid particles with associated orientations and aspect ratios.</text></s>

<s sid="193"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res94" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The lower-bound is adjusted at area fractions below 0.3 to allow for a range of aspect ratios where the random arrangement of particles appears more regular than for discs.</text></s>

<s sid="206"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thus, a material with an Area Disorder less than HRE is said to be spatially well-dispersed, or greater than PR/line-random (LR) is said to be poorly dispersed.</text></s>

Conclusions
<s sid="213"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Studies like the ones discussed in this article, for particle size dispersion and ellipticality of the shape, inform us of when differences in particle morphology (from that of identical discs) should or should not significantly affect the estimates of randomly-dispersed nanoparticles.</text></s>
<s sid="214"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These estimates are used as the basis from which to decide whether a material has nanoparticles dispersed better (hence more regularly arranged) or worse (more clustered) than random.</text></s>
<s sid="215"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con25" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The microstructure is found to change with aspect ratio and area fraction, even in the absence of any chemical or crystalline growth effects.</text></s>
<s sid="216"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con26" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>At low aspect ratios, (relative to the area fraction) the particles behave particle-like and can be well described by disc/point particle theories.</text></s>
<s sid="217"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con27" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>At moderate aspect ratios, the overall space restriction partially correlates the orientation of neighbouring particle.</text></s>
<s sid="218"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con28" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>At high aspect ratios a grain-like microstructure is formed, at a predictable onset, where the orientations of three or more neighbouring particles are correlated.</text></s>
<s sid="219"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con29" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In these systems particles may be better treated as line-like.</text></s>
<s sid="220"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con30" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These studies have hence shown that ordering in polymers, which may previously have been attributed to crystallinity or attraction between particles, can arise from particle shape alone.</text></s>
<s sid="221"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con31" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Overall, it is quite clear that, given the different behaviour of highly elongated particles, we will need to use much better reference systems than those of point or spherical particles if we are to make use of dispersion methods to interpret images of high aspect nanotubes or fibres.</text></s>
<s sid="222"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con32" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>While differences between the current definitions of a well-dispersed system means that discrepancies in interpretation can exist, our work highlights that the inherent nature of dispersion can also prevent there being a unique value for the selected dispersion parameter, that covers all realistic particle morphologies with equivalent dispersion quality.</text></s>
<s sid="223"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con33" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>For example, a random set of spherical particles did not measure the same as a set of elliptical particles because of shape and size considerations.</text></s>
