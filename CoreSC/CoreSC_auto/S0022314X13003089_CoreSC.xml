<s sid="11"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot2" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>A classical problem regarding integral-valued polynomials is to find proper subsets S of OK such that if f(X) is any polynomial in K[X] such that f(s) is in OK for all s in S then f(X) is integral-valued over OK.</text></s>
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>A subset S of OK with this property is usually called a polynomially dense subset of OK.</text></s>
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot3" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>For example, it is easy to see that cofinite subsets of OK have this property.</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj1" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>For a general reference of polynomially dense subsets and the so-called polynomial closure see [1] (see also the references contained in there).</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj2" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Obviously, for a polynomially dense subset S we have Int(S,OK)≑{f∈K[X]|f(S)⊂OK}=Int(OK) (in general we only have one containment).</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Gilmer gave a criterion which characterizes polynomially dense subsets of a Dedekind domain with finite residue fields [6].</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj4" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>His result was later elaborated by McQuillan in this way ([9]; we state it for the ring of integers of a number field): a subset S of OK is polynomially dense in OK if and only if, for every non-zero prime ideal P of OK, S is dense in OK with respect to the P-adic topology.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj5" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>By means of this criterion, we show here the following theorem.</text></s>
Theorem 1.1
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj6" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Let K be a number field of degree n over Q.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj7" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Let OK,n be the set of algebraic integers of K of degree n.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj8" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Then OK,n is polynomially dense in OK.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj9" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The previous problem concerns the integrality of the values of a polynomial with coefficients in a number field K over the set of algebraic integers of K.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>We also address here our interest to the study of the integrality of the values of a polynomial with rational coefficients over the set of algebraic integers of a proper finite extension of Q, or, more in general, over a set of algebraic integers which lie in possibly infinitely many number fields, but of bounded degree.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj10" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In this direction, Loper and Werner introduced in [8] the following ring of integral-valued polynomials:IntQ(OK)≑{f∈Q[X]|f(OK)⊂OK}.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj11" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>This ring is the contraction to Q[X] of Int(OK).</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj12" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>It is easy to see that it is a subring of the usual ring of integer-valued polynomials Int(Z)={f∈Q[X]|f(Z)⊂Z}.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod8" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Moreover, this is always a strict containment: take any prime integer p such that there exists a prime ideal of OK above p whose residue field strictly contains Z/pZ; then the polynomial X(X-1)⋯(X-(p-1))/p is in Int(Z) but it is not in IntQ(OK).</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod9" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>In [8] another ring of integral-valued polynomials has been introduced.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod10" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Given an integer n, we denote by An the set of all algebraic integers of degree less than or equal to n in a fixed algebraic closure Q¯ of Q.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod11" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>We define the following ringIntQ(An)≑{f∈Q[X]|f(An)⊂An}.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod12" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Notice that for n=1 we have the usual ring Int(Z).</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod13" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Given any algebraic integer α of degree n and f(X) any polynomial with rational coefficients, f(α) belongs to Q(α) and in particular its degree is less than or equal to n.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod14" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Therefore, a polynomial f∈Q[X] is in IntQ(An) if and only if for every α in An, f(α) is in the ring A∞⊂Q¯ of all algebraic integers.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod15" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>We have then IntQ(An)=IntQ(An,A∞)={f∈Q[X]|f(An)⊂A∞}, where the latter ring is the contraction to Q[X] of the ring Int(An,A∞), which is the ring of polynomials in Q¯[X] which are integer-valued over the subset An of A∞ (notice that by definition the quotient field of A∞ is Q¯).</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod16" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>In particular, this implies that for all n∈N we have IntQ(An)⊂IntQ(An-1).</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod17" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>As the authors in [8] show, the ring IntQ(An) is also equal to(1)IntQ(An)=⋂[K:Q]⩽nIntQ(OK) where the intersection is over the set of all number fields K of degree less than or equal to n.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>One of the reason why these rings have been introduced was to show the existence of a Prüfer domain lying properly between Z[X] and Int(Z) (see question Q1 at the beginning of [8]).</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Indeed, they prove that IntQ(An) and IntQ(OK) for any number field K are examples of such rings.</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa3" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>We can ask whether a result similar to Theorem 1.1 holds for An.</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod18" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>More specifically, let An be the subset of An of elements of degree equal to n.</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod19" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>We consider the following ringIntQ(An,An)≑{f∈Q[X]|f(An)⊂An} that is, polynomials with rational coefficients which map the set of algebraic integers of degree n to algebraic integers (which of course have degree less than or equal to n; like before, notice that IntQ(An,An)=IntQ(An,A∞), with the obvious notation).</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod20" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>A priori this ring contains IntQ(An), since An is a subset of An.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod21" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>By Theorem 1.1 it follows that there exist algebraic integers of degree smaller than n (namely, the ring of integers of all number fields of degree n) on which any f∈IntQ(An,An) is integral-valued (we treat this consequence of Theorem 1.1 in Remark 3.2).</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj13" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Using the same terminology adopted for subsets of the ring of integers of a number field, we say that An is not polynomially closed in An.</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj14" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The main result of this paper is that the two rings of integral-valued polynomials over An and An actually coincide:Theorem 1.2</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj15" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>For every positive integer n we have:IntQ(An,An)=IntQ(An).</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa4" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>In this way, in order to check whether a polynomial f∈Q[X] is integral-valued over the set of algebraic integers of degree bounded by n, it is sufficient to check if f(X) is integral-valued over the set of algebraic integers of degree exactly equal to n.</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res1" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>As above, we say that An is polynomially dense in An.</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res2" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In particular, Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 also show that it is not necessary to take a set S of algebraic integers properly containing Z to exhibit a Prüfer domain properly contained between Z[X] and Int(Z) (specifically, IntQ(S,A∞)).</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj16" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The ring IntQ(An) has been introduced in [8] also for another reason.</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod22" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>We denote by Mn(Z) the noncommutative Z-algebra of n×n matrices with entries in Z.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod23" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Given a matrix M∈Mn(Z) and a polynomial f∈Q[X], f(M) is a matrix with rational entries.</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod24" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>If f(M) has integer entries, we say that f(X) is integer-valued on M.</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod25" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>We consider the ring of polynomials which are integer-valued over all the matrices of Mn(Z) (introduced in [2]):Int(Mn(Z))≑{f∈Q[X]|f(M)∈Mn(Z),∀M∈Mn(Z)}.</text></s>
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod26" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Like IntQ(An), Int(Mn(Z)) is a subring of the ring of integer-valued polynomial Int(Z) (Z embeds into Mn(Z) as the subalgebra of scalar matrices).</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod27" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>In [8] the following theorem is proved: Theorem 1.3</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod28" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The ring Int(Mn(Z)) is not integrally closed and its integral closure is IntQ(An), which is a Prüfer domain.</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod29" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>What is behind the containment between these two rings of integer-valued polynomials, is based on the following fact: if f∈Q[X] is integer-valued over a matrix M∈Mn(Z), then f(X) is integral-valued over the set of roots of the characteristic polynomial of M, which are elements of An (that is, the eigenvalues of M as a matrix over Q¯).</text></s>
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This fact can be easily proved directly, but we will give an alternative point of view based on a representation of the ring Int(Mn(Z)) as an intersection of pullbacks of Q[X], which turn out to be equal to a particular class of rings of integer-valued polynomials over algebraic integers.</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res4" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Our Theorem 1.2 is proved by means of a result of Frisch ([3, Proposition 6.2], [4]) which says that the set of matrices with irreducible characteristic polynomial is polynomially dense in Mn(Z).</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj17" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>We give a summary of the paper.</text></s>
<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa5" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>In the second section we use Gilmerʼs criterion to prove a generalization of Theorem 1.1 for orders of a number field K.</text></s>
<s sid="63"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa6" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>By means of a result of Győry, we also show that if we remove from OK,n those elements which generates OK as a Z-algebra (if any) we still get a polynomially dense subset.</text></s>
<s sid="64"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod30" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>In Section 3 we establish the connection between the subring of Q[X] of integer-valued polynomials over a set of n×n integral matrices with irreducible characteristic polynomial in a prescribed set P (these rings have been studied in [10]) and rings of integral-valued polynomials over the roots of the polynomials in P (which are algebraic integers of degree n), showing that the latter is the integral closure of the former.</text></s>
<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod31" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>This result is achieved by means of Theorem 3.1.</text></s>
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod32" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>We need a result from [10] which says that the ring of integer-valued polynomials over matrices with prescribed characteristic polynomial p∈Z[X] is equal to the pullback ring Z[X]+p(X)⋅Q[X].</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod33" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Theorem 3.1 proves that the integral closure of the intersection of a collection of pullbacks of this kind is the intersection of the integral closure of the pullbacks of the family.</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod34" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The crucial assumption we need is that the degree of the polynomials of the set P is bounded by the above integer n.</text></s>
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>From this result, Theorem 1.2 follows.</text></s>
<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In Remark 3.2 we stress that Theorem 1.1 does not imply directly Theorem 1.2.</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We also prove another related result, analogous to Theorem 1.3.</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod35" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>As IntQ(An) is the integral closure of the ring Int(Mn(Z)), in the same way, for every number field K, IntQ(OK) (which by (1) is an overring of IntQ(An)) is equal to the integral closure of a certain overring of Int(Mn(Z)), namely, the ring of integer-valued polynomials over the set MnK(Z) of matrices with characteristic polynomial equal to a minimal polynomial of some algebraic integer of maximal degree of K.</text></s>

<s sid="251"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod50" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>By Galois invariance (see Remark 3.1) for each polynomial p∈P we can just take one of its roots.</text></s>
<s sid="252"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con13" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In this way we have(10)Int(MnP(Z),Mn(Z))=RA(P)⊆SA(P)=IntQ(A(S),An).</text></s>
<s sid="253"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con14" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>By Theorem 3.1, the latter ring is the integral closure of Int(MnP(Z),Mn(Z)).</text></s>
<s sid="254"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In particular, by Remark 3.3, Int(MnP(Z),Mn(Z)) is integrally closed if and only if Z[α]=OQ(α), for all α∈A(S).</text></s>

<s sid="256"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Notice that the set of roots of the minimal polynomials of algebraic integers of degree n in K (this set is denoted by PnK in Remark 3.5) is exactly OK,n, that is: A(PnK)=OK,n.</text></s>
Then (10) gives:(11)Int(MnK(Z),Mn(Z))=ROK,n⊂SOK,n=IntQ(OK).
<s sid="257"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The equality SOK,n=IntQ(OK) is given by Theorem 1.1.</text></s>

<s sid="261"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In general there are plenty of α∈OK,n such that this condition is not satisfied (see Proposition 2.1).</text></s>
<s sid="262"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This concludes the proof of Theorem 3.2.</text></s>
<s sid="263"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In the same way, by (9) and (11) we have(12)Int(Mn(Z))=⋂[K:Q]=nInt(MnK(Z),Mn(Z))=⋂[K:Q]=nROK,n=RAn (the latter equality is given in Remark 3.2).</text></s>
<s sid="264"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con25" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We remark that, as already mentioned in [8], this representation of Int(Mn(Z)) as an intersection of the rings Rα for α∈An, shows that Int(Mn(Z)) is not Prüfer, since there are many overrings Rα which are not integrally closed: by Proposition 3.1 it is sufficient to consider an algebraic integer α of degree n such that Z[α]⊊OQ(α); then the corresponding Rα is such an overring.</text></s>
<s sid="265"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con26" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Finally, since for all n we have Int(Mn(Z))⊂Int(Mn-1(Z)), by (12) RAn⊂RAn-1, so that RAn=⋂m=1,…,nRAm=RAn.</text></s>
<s sid="266"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con27" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In particular, by Theorem 3.1, the rings SAn and SAn are equal, since they are the integral closure of RAn and RAn, respectively, and these two rings coincide.</text></s>
<s sid="267"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con28" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>By (3), the equality SAn=SAn is exactly Theorem 1.2.</text></s>
