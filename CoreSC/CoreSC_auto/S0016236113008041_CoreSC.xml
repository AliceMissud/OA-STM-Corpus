Introduction
<s sid="10"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met6" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Calcium looping is a method of CO2 capture which utilises fluidised bed technology, whereby a particulate bed is fluidised using a gas within a reactor.</text></s>

<s sid="253"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con46" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Element emissions to the gaseous phase appeared to be influenced by sorbent mass, with the majority of species increasing in concentration as sorbent mass increased.</text></s>

<s sid="255"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res93" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The mass balances however show that compared to the concentration of elements in the sorbent, the concentrations partitioning to the gaseous phase is very low.</text></s>
