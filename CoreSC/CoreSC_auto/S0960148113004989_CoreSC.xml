<BODY>

Introduction
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>With the increasing cost of energy, tidal turbines are becoming a competitive and promising option for renewable electricity generation.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>A key advantage of tidal energy is that the power extracted is predictable in advance, which is highly attractive for grid management.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot2" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>In order to amortise the fixed costs of installation and grid connection, arrays consisting of hundreds of tidal turbines must typically be deployed at a particular site.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot3" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>This raises the question of where to place the turbines within the site and how to tune them individually in order to maximise the power output; finding the optimal configuration is of huge importance as it could substantially change the energy captured and possibly determine whether the project is economically viable.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, the determination of the optimal configuration is difficult because of the complex flow interactions between turbines and the fact that the power output depends sensitively on the flow velocity at the turbine positions.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This problem has heretofore been addressed in two different ways.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met12" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>One approach is to simplify the tidal flow model such that the solutions are either available as explicit analytical expressions, or are extremely fast to compute.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met13" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This means that the optimum can be analytically derived, or that the whole parameter space of possible configurations can be rapidly explored.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met14" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>For example, Bryden and Couch [5] and Garrett and Cummins [15] optimised simplified models to derive an estimate for the maximum energy that can be extracted from a tidal basin.</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met15" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Vennell [39,40] used simple one-dimensional models to demonstrate the importance of tuning each turbine individually to account for the channel geometry, turbine positions, and the tidal forcing.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met16" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Thus, optimisation of farms is a crucial step needed to achieve their full potential.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met17" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>However, Vennell [42] observes that this optimisation requires many model runs (if performed naively), thus making it computationally infeasible to use expensive, physically-accurate flow models for this task.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met18" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>While this approach can provide a coarse estimate for the power potential of a site, these simplified models cannot accurately capture the complex nonlinear flow interactions between turbines.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met19" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The second approach is to use more complex flow models to accurately predict the tidal flow, the turbine wakes, and the resulting power output.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These models are usually formulated as numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs).</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res1" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The computational expense of these models prohibits the exploration of the whole parameter space [38].</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj1" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Consequently, typically only a handful of manually identified turbine configurations are investigated in a given scenario [1].</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met20" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Divett et al. [8] compared the power output of four different layouts in a rectangular channel by solving the two-dimensional nonlinear shallow water equations and was able to improve the power outcome by over 50% compared to a regular layout.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met21" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Lee et al. [28] used a three-dimensional model to investigate how the distance between adjacent rows in a regular array layout impacts the turbine efficiency and showed an efficiency decay for distances of less than three times the turbine diameter.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met22" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>While these studies show the potential of improving the performance by changing the turbine positions, such manual optimisation guided by intuition and experience becomes difficult in a realistic domain with complex bottom bathymetry, flow dynamics and hundreds of turbines.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met23" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In this paper, we present a novel technique for maximising the power extraction of array configurations that combines the physical fidelity of PDE-based flow models with advanced automated optimisation techniques.</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met24" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This approach allows the identification of optimal solutions in a computationally feasible number of iterations, circumventing the computational limitations noted in Ref.</text></s>
[42].
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met25" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The turbine configuration problem is formulated as a PDE-constrained optimisation problem, which is a major topic of research in applied mathematics [20,21].</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met26" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The resulting maximisation problem is solved using a gradient-based optimisation algorithm that takes orders of magnitude fewer iterations than genetic algorithms or simulated annealing approaches (see e.g.</text></s>
Ref.
[3]).
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met27" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In this paper, the power extracted by an array configuration is predicted using a two-dimensional nonlinear shallow water model, which captures the interactions between the geometry, the turbines, and the flow.</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met28" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The gradient of the power is efficiently computed using the adjoint technique of variational calculus, which solves an auxiliary system that propagates causality backwards through the physical system.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met29" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This yields the gradient at a cost almost independent of the number of turbines to be optimised, which is crucial for the method to be applied to large arrays.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met30" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This gradient is used by the optimisation algorithm to automatically reposition the turbines and to adjust their tuning parameters.</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res2" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The flow solution is re-evaluated, and the algorithm iterated until an optimum is found.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This approach has several key advantages.</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Firstly, it closes the optimisation loop, by accounting for the effects of the turbines on the flow field itself.</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot4" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>This is necessary to find the actual optimum of the nonlinear optimisation problem.</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Secondly, unlike gradient-free methods, the approach requires a relatively small number of model evaluations and scales to large numbers of turbines, which is necessary for the optimisation of industrial arrays.</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For example, in Section 6, an array of 256 turbines is optimised in a realistic domain at an approximate cost of 200 flow solutions.</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met31" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Thirdly, the optimisation algorithm can incorporate complex constraints such as minimum separation distances, bathymetry gradient constraints, and legal site restrictions.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met32" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Finally, the same mathematical framework extends naturally to more realistic flow models such as the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, and to other functionals such as profit or environmental impact.</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met33" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The approach is implemented in an open-source software framework called OpenTidalFarm; all code and examples from this paper are available at http://opentidalfarm.org.</text></s>
Optimisation algorithms
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met34" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Optimisation algorithms can be divided into two categories: gradient-free and gradient-based algorithms.</text></s>
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met35" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Gradient-free optimisation algorithms use the functional of interest (in this case, power extracted by the array) as a black box.</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met36" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>They proceed by evaluating the functional at many points in parameter space and use these values to decide which areas merit further exploration.</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>While these methods tend to be robust and can, under certain smoothness conditions, provably find globally optimal solutions [33], they typically require a very large number of functional evaluations that scales linearly or superlinearly with the number of parameters to be optimised.</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For example, Bilbao and Alba [3] used a genetic algorithm that mimics the process of natural evolution to optimise the location of 8 wind turbines.</text></s>
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res4" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The algorithm was able to improve the power output by about 70% compared to the initial layout after 17,300 functional evaluations.</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This large number of evaluations clearly introduces a practical upper limit for the number of turbines that can be optimised.</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod1" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>This difficulty is compounded if a more realistic (and hence more expensive) model is used.</text></s>
<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod2" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>By contrast, gradient-based optimisation algorithms use additional information to update the position in parameter space at each iteration: the first or higher derivatives of the functional of interest with respect to the parameters.</text></s>
<s sid="63"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod3" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Depending on the problem, this can lead to a significant reduction in the number of iterations required compared to gradient-free algorithms, making these the only feasible choice for large scale optimisation problems [20].</text></s>
<s sid="64"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod4" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>One caveat of applying gradient-based optimisation algorithms is that they find only local optima.</text></s>
<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod5" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>This issue can be circumvented by using hybrid approaches [22].</text></s>
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot5" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>The main difficulty of applying gradient-based methods is that the implementation of the gradient computation can be difficult for complex models, as it involves differentiating through the solution of a partial differential equation.</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>One way to obtain the derivative information is to approximate the gradient using finite differences.</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa3" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>However, a major disadvantage of this approach is that a single gradient evaluation requires a large number of functional evaluations that scales linearly with the number of optimisation parameters.</text></s>
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa4" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>This sets a practical upper bound on the number of turbines to be optimised, and discards the main advantage of gradient-based optimisation algorithms.</text></s>
<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj2" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Alternatively, the tangent linearisation of the model (i.e. the derivative of the model evaluated at a particular solution) can efficiently compute the derivative of all outputs with respect to a single input, while the adjoint linearisation can efficiently compute the derivative of a single output with respect to all inputs [19].</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met37" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>For the turbine optimisation problem, we wish to maximise a single output (the power extracted) with respect to many input parameters (the positions and tuning parameters of the turbines); this means that the adjoint approach is the natural choice, as the required gradient information can be computed in a number of equation solves that is independent of the number of turbines.</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met38" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The development of adjoint models is generally considered as very complicated [17,30].</text></s>
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met39" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>However, this problem has been solved in recent work for the case where the forward model is discretised using finite elements, in the high-level FEniCS framework [11].</text></s>
<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met40" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This allows for the extremely rapid development of optimally efficient adjoint models, which significantly reduces the development effort required to implement gradient-based optimisation algorithms for PDE-constrained optimisation problems [13].</text></s>
<s sid="75"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first application of the adjoint method to the optimisation of turbine arrays.</text></s>
<s sid="76"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>While the examples are shown in the marine context, it is expected that the presented techniques can also be applied to the optimisation of wind farms.</text></s>
<s sid="77"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>As the wind turbine layout problem is both closely related and better studied, we next review techniques proposed for its solution.</text></s>
Wind farm optimisation
<s sid="78"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj4" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Layout optimisation for wind farms has been addressed in numerous studies, most of which are based on gradient-free optimisation algorithms.</text></s>
<s sid="79"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In particular, evolutionary methods [2] are known to yield good results (Ref.</text></s>
<s sid="80"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>[35] and the references therein).</text></s>
<s sid="81"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp1" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>These algorithms mimic the process of natural evolution by considering a population of candidate solutions on which it executes an evolutionary process to find the &quot;fittest&quot; solution.</text></s>
<s sid="82"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp2" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>A related method is particle swarm optimisation [24], which considers a population of candidate solutions called particles, that move through the parameter space and influence each other to drive the swarm to the best solution.</text></s>
<s sid="83"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met41" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Wan et al. [43] applied particle swarm optimisation on an analytical wake model to optimise the location of 39 wind turbines and showed that this approach can yield better optimal solutions than genetic algorithms.</text></s>
<s sid="84"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met42" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Simulated annealing algorithms [26] are probabilistic optimisation methods that exploit an analogy between the way in which a metal heats and cools into a minimum energy crystalline structure (the annealing process) and the search for a minimum in a more abstract system.</text></s>
<s sid="85"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met43" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Bilbao and Alba [3] used an analytical wake model to compare a simulated annealing algorithm with a genetic optimisation algorithm.</text></s>
<s sid="86"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met44" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In a scenario with 47 turbines, the number of model evaluations was reduced from 1,036,200 with the genetic algorithm to 61,802 with simulated annealing.</text></s>
<s sid="87"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met45" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>However, such a large number of evaluations would be infeasible for a more complex PDE-based model.</text></s>
<s sid="88"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met46" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Few publications solve the layout problem with gradient-based optimisation algorithms.</text></s>
<s sid="89"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met47" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Lackner and Elkinton [27] optimised the position of two wind turbines by applying a gradient-based optimisation algorithm to a simplified energy production model with an analytical expression.</text></s>

<s sid="91"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>With this additional derivative information, the number of iterations was reduced by approximately an order of magnitude to less than 300 iterations, for a similar power extraction.</text></s>
<s sid="92"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Finally, Fagerfjäll [10] showed how mixed integer linear programming techniques can be used to optimise for both the number and position of turbines.</text></s>
<s sid="93"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>All of these publications use very simplified flow models for which the gradient is either available analytically or can be easily approximated.</text></s>
<s sid="94"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Furthermore, none of the reviewed papers use gradient-based methods with the adjoint technique to find an optimal configuration in a physically realistic model.</text></s>
<s sid="95"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>While this prior research on wind farm optimisation is relevant, there are key differences between wind and tidal turbine arrays.</text></s>
<s sid="96"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Firstly, the flow in a tidal channel is dominantly driven by the predictable tidal forcing, while wind flow modelling is inherently stochastic and needs to include the temporal uncertainty in the magnitude and direction of the wind forcing.</text></s>
<s sid="97"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Secondly, the ratio of turbine height to free-surface elevation is significantly different: while the rotor diameter of a wind turbine is small compared to the height of the atmosphere, tidal turbines typically have diameters of around 20 m and are deployed in water depths of approximately 50 m or less.</text></s>
<s sid="98"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This leads to little undisturbed flow above the turbine which could contribute to wake recovery and thus potentially increases the length of the wake compared to wind turbines [6,8].</text></s>
<s sid="99"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Finally, if a tidal farm occupies a large fraction of the channel's width and depth then the presence of turbines significantly affects the flow velocity upstream of the farm [14,39].</text></s>
<s sid="100"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In wind farms, this is not the case [41].</text></s>
<s sid="101"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This interaction adds an additional complication to the optimisation of tidal farms.</text></s>
<s sid="102"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The remaining sections are organised as follows.</text></s>
<s sid="103"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>In Section 2, we formulate the turbine configuration problem as an optimisation problem constrained by the shallow water equations.</text></s>
<s sid="104"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Section 3 discusses the discretisation and implementation, which is then verified in Section 4.</text></s>
<s sid="105"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In Section 5, we demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach on four idealised scenarios with 32 turbines.</text></s>
<s sid="106"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Section 6 presents an application of this approach where the positions of up to 256 turbines are optimised in a geometry motivated by the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, Scotland.</text></s>
<s sid="107"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj5" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Finally, we make some concluding remarks in Section 7.</text></s>
Problem formulation
<s sid="108"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj6" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In this section we formulate the optimal configuration of turbines in an array as a PDE-constrained optimisation problem in the following abstract form:(1)maxz,mJ(z,m)subjecttoF(z,m)=0,bl≤m≤bu,g(m)≤0,where J(z,m)∈R is the functional of interest, m are the design parameters, F(z,m) is a PDE operator parameterised by m with solution z, bl and bu are lower and upper bound constraints for the design parameters, and g(m) enforces additional restrictions on the design parameters.</text></s>
<s sid="109"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj7" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In this work z = (u,η) is the solution (horizontal velocity, free-surface displacement) of the shallow water equations written in the form F(z,m) = 0, and m contains the configuration (position and/or tuning parameters) of the turbines.</text></s>
<s sid="110"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod6" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The bounds bl and bu are used to enforce that the turbines remain in a prescribed area (here assumed a rectangle for simplicity), while g(m) is used to enforce a minimum distance between any two turbines (e.g. as a multiple of the turbine diameter).</text></s>
<s sid="111"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod7" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The optimisation problem (1) can be reduced by using the fact that the constraint equation F(z,m) = 0 implicitly maps any choice of m to a unique solution z.</text></s>
<s sid="112"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod8" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Hence, the solution z can be considered as an implicit function of the optimisation parameters: z ≡ z(m).</text></s>
<s sid="113"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod9" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>By substituting this operator into the functional of interest, we obtain the reduced optimisation problem:(2)maxmJ(z(m),m)subjecttobl≤m≤bu,g(m)≤0.</text></s>
<s sid="114"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod10" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>While it is possible to solve the optimisation problem in unreduced form (1), we choose to solve the reduced form, as it is usually preferable for time-dependent governing equations [29].</text></s>
The design parameters
<s sid="115"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod11" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>For the turbine optimisation problem considered here, the design parameter m is a vector containing the positions, and optionally the tuning parameters, of the turbines.</text></s>
<s sid="116"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod12" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>If the turbine tuning parameters are fixed, then the design parameters contain only the (x,y) positions of the N turbines encoded in the form:</text></s>
<s sid="117"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod13" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>If additionally the turbines are to be individually tuned, then the vector m is extended to contain the friction coefficient Ki of each turbine:</text></s>
<s sid="118"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod14" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>This could be further generalised to account for any number of turbine parameters.</text></s>
The PDE constraint

<s sid="365"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con43" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The main purpose of the southern and northern walls is to funnel the flow into and retain the flow inside the site boundary.</text></s>

<s sid="367"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con45" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The water predominantly flows in from the northwest, which is why the northern wall stops short on the western side.</text></s>
<s sid="368"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con46" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We hypothesise that the decay of the turbine density on the western side of the northern wall acts to funnel water through the barrages.</text></s>
<s sid="369"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs21" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>A similar density decay is visible in the optimised layout of scenario 1 (Fig. 5b).</text></s>
•
<s sid="370"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res140" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The flow trapped inside the site domain attempts to escape through the northern and southern walls, which causes the arcing of the western and eastern barrages close to the northern and southern boundaries (Fig. 14a and b).</text></s>
<s sid="371"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con47" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Since the prevailing incoming flow is towards the southeast, more turbines are placed on the southern wall to retain the flow.</text></s>

<s sid="375"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res141" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Due to the cubic dependence of the power extraction on the speed, the power per turbine is approximately doubled in the 128 turbine case, and so the total power extraction of the two cases is almost the same.</text></s>

Conclusions
<s sid="377"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con49" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In this work, the optimal configuration of tidal turbine farms was formulated as an optimisation problem constrained by partial differential equations describing the flow.</text></s>
<s sid="378"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con50" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This formulation allows the direct application of sophisticated mathematical techniques to its solution, particularly the adjoint technique for rapidly evaluating gradients.</text></s>
<s sid="379"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con51" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The optimisation of tidal turbine farms is necessary to realise their full potential, but without gradient-based optimisation techniques the computational cost is prohibitive [42].</text></s>
<s sid="380"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con52" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The approach presented here has several key advantages.</text></s>
<s sid="381"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con53" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It fully accounts for the nonlinear interactions between the geometry, the turbines, and the flow throughout the optimisation.</text></s>
<s sid="382"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con54" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The use of gradient-based optimisation algorithms combined with the adjoint technique enables the use of physically-realistic flow models, even for a large number of turbines.</text></s>
<s sid="383"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con55" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Once the flow model inputs are specified (domain, boundary conditions, initial array configuration, etc.), the optimisation is fully automatic.</text></s>
<s sid="384"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con56" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The approach extends naturally to more realistic flow models, and to different functionals of interest such as profit or environmental impact.</text></s>
<s sid="385"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con57" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The algorithm was first applied to the optimisation of four idealised scenarios, both to demonstrate the capability of the method and to build physical intuition.</text></s>
<s sid="386"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con58" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In all cases, the optimisation algorithm was successful in significantly increasing the power extracted by the farm, at a computationally feasible cost.</text></s>
<s sid="387"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con59" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The algorithm was then successfully applied to a more realistic optimisation problem, involving a site of major industrial interest, accurate shoreline geometry, and an industrially relevant number of turbines.</text></s>
<s sid="388"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con60" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Four main extensions are required to apply this in an industrial setting.</text></s>
<s sid="389"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con61" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Firstly, the simulations must be driven by realistic tidal forcing, and incorporate a wider model domain around the site to be investigated.</text></s>
<s sid="390"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con62" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This also includes extending the forward model to be forced by a head loss instead of a fixed inflow velocity to incorporate the impact of large arrays on the free-stream velocity [39].</text></s>
<s sid="391"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con63" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Secondly, bathymetric effects must be accounted for.</text></s>
<s sid="392"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con64" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thirdly, the flow model must then be validated against real-world measurements.</text></s>
<s sid="393"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con65" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Finally, the wake modelling should be improved via a turbulence closure and a realistic power curve used.</text></s>
<s sid="394"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con66" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>All of these advances are the subject of ongoing work.</text></s>
<s sid="395"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con67" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The source-code of the turbine farm optimisation software and all examples are open-source and available at http://opentidalfarm.org.</text></s>
