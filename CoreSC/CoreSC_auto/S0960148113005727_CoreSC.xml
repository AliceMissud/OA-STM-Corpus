Introduction
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Ageing is a fact of life.</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Its effects are inevitable for all kinds of machinery, reducing the efficiency, output and availability of steam and gas turbines, solar PV modules, batteries and automobiles alike.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Previous work on wind turbines has considered the reliability of individual components and the effect of ageing on availability, but any impact on the energy production of turbines or farms has not been widely reported.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>If load factors (also known as capacity factors) decrease significantly with age, wind farms will produce a lower cumulative lifetime output, increasing the levelised cost of electricity from the plants.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp1" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>If the rate of degradation were too great, it could become worthwhile to prematurely replace the turbines with new models, implying that the economic life of the turbine was shorter than its technical life, further increasing its cost.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This could have significant policy implications for the desirability of investing in wind power, as argued in a recent report by Hughes for the Renewable Energy Foundation (REF) [1].</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>That report suggested that the load factors of wind farms in the UK have declined by 5-13% per year, normalising for month-by-month variations in wind speeds.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These findings could represent a significant hurdle for the wind industry, but they require replication.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Several factors can confound the relationship between age and observed output in a fleet of wind farms, given that a turbine's output is dependent on wind speeds at its site and the efficiency with which it captures the energy in that wind.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For example, if wind speeds have fallen slightly over time, farms would have lower load factors in recent months, when they were at their oldest, giving a spurious correlation between age and poor performance.</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp2" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>If improvements in design increase a turbine's output relative to capacity (its power coefficient) then newer turbines (of the improved design) will have higher load factors than old turbines, so that turbine output appears to decline with age, when really it improves with newer generations.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp3" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>On the other hand, if the best (windiest) sites were occupied first, then old farms could have higher load factors than new ones built on inferior sites, so that turbines would appear to improve with age.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>This paper uses public domain data to infer the hour-by-hour wind speeds at the site of every wind farm in the UK, and the power curve for each farm's model of turbine to estimate the output that they would ideally produce.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj5" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>This technique corrects for the confounding factors (wind patterns, turbine model and site quality), and validates well for farms that report their half-hourly output to National Grid.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj6" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Simulated ideal outputs are compared with actual monthly load factors from a large portion of the UK's fleet over the last decade (282 wind farms, 4.5 GW, 53 TWh), yielding the normalised performance of each wind farm accounting for its wind resource availability, and a set of weather-corrected load factors which reveal the effects of ageing.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>We measure the level of age-related degradation at the national level, accounting for the vintage of turbine and local site conditions at each wind farm.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa3" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>We test different generations of technology and individual wind farms to confirm that specific units experienced similar declines in performance.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We find the ageing effect to be present, but much smaller than predicted by Hughes, in line with experience of other rotating machinery.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The specific causes of this performance loss and their relative contribution are not considered in this paper, although an overview of potential reasons is given in the discussion and conclusions.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Due to the amount of data and processing required for this study we provide online supplementary material which documents our sources and their validation in greater depth, along with downloadable datasets of UK wind farms and their energy output histories.</text></s>
Previous studies
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>All machinery experiences an unrecoverable loss in performance over time.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Gas turbine efficiency suffers an unrecoverable decline of 0.3-0.6% per year despite regular washing and component replacement, or by 0.75-2.25% without [2].</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Similarly, the output of solar photovoltaic panels declines by 0.5% per year on average [3].</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This loss in performance is not routinely accounted for in studies of the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of wind power.</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Recent studies by Mott MacDonald, Parsons Brinckerhoff and Arup accounted for the efficiency of conventional plants falling by 0.15-0.55% per year, but omitted any such factor for wind turbines [4-6].</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Previous studies of wind turbines have focussed on availability and reliability [7-9].</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>There appear to be no long term fleet-level studies into loss of output from wind farms in open literature.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Regardless of technology, quantifying performance degradation is difficult because consistent and validated field data is hard to obtain [2].</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj7" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The recent study by Hughes [1] is therefore significant, in that we believe it is the first to attempt to estimate the rate of decline in wind farm load factors on a national scale.</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met1" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Hughes analysed over 10 years of operating data from the British and Danish fleets of turbines, finding rates of performance degradation that are much higher than for other technologies, and which vary remarkably between the UK and Denmark, and between onshore and offshore turbines.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This was based on econometric analysis of monthly load factors, using a regression which corrected for the quality of each wind farm's location, the monthly variation in national wind conditions, and the age of each farm.</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod1" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Hughes argues (and shows mathematically) that accounting for monthly wind conditions with a set of 'fixed effects' determined by the regression is econometrically superior to using a measure of average wind speeds across the country, since site-specific conditions differ from the national average and the output of wind turbines depends non-linearly on the wind speed at every moment in time, which is very poorly captured by its average over a month.</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa4" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>We therefore use wind speed data with high temporal and spatial resolution, and measure the performance of wind farms by estimating their theoretical potential output over the course of a month and comparing this with the actual reported load factors.</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa5" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>While we believe we are the first researchers to assess wind farm performance with this kind of ex-post data, a number of papers present techniques to estimate output levels from time series of wind data.</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod2" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Many studies have used hourly wind speed data recorded by met masts; for example investigations into wind variability by Pöyry [10] and SKM [11], and estimates of future national output by Green et al. [12,13] and Sturt and Strbac [14].</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod3" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Hourly met mast speeds have been directly compared to metered wind farm load factors in Northern Spain [15] and Scotland [16], showing that accurate estimates can be made for monthly energy generation, but not for hourly power outputs.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>More recent studies use reanalyses as a source of wind speed data: atmospheric boundary layer models which process physical observations from met masts and other sources into a coherent and spatially complete dataset, and are widely used to produce wind atlases.</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Kiss et al. [17] were first to compare the European ERA-40 reanalysis to nacelle measurements of wind speed and power output at two turbines in Hungary, finding &quot;surprisingly good&quot; agreement.</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Hawkins et al. [18] were able to replicate UK monthly load factors using a custom reanalysis model, while Kubik et al. [19] compared the global NASA reanalysis to half-hourly farm output in Northern Ireland, finding it to be more accurate than met mast data.</text></s>
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa6" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The first practical application appears to have been made by Ofgem to estimate the equivalent firm capacity of the UK's wind fleet during winter peaks in demand [20].</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa7" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Both Hawkins and Ofgem noted that the reanalysis outputs need to be scaled down by a constant factor (29% and 20% respectively) in order to match actual production in the UK, a finding which we elaborate upon in this paper.</text></s>
Data sources
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Predicting a given wind farm's output is far from being a new science: on-site monitoring of conditions using wind turbine SCADA systems is commonplace; and software tools such as WaSP or consultancies such as GL Garrad Hassan are widely used in the field.</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Data is not made publicly available, and these services come at a price of several thousand Euros.</text></s>
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>On the other hand, national average data cannot reveal what is happening at individual wind farms.</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa8" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>We therefore employ farm-specific data for output and site-specific data for wind speeds, taken from free and publicly accessible datasets.</text></s>

<s sid="64"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met7" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Hughes extracted and cleaned this data, cross-linking outputs with details about each wind farm (its capacity and date of commissioning), and ensured that each wind farm contained only the same model and vintage of turbine [1].</text></s>

<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met11" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>We further validated this dataset, corrected the commissioning date for 15 wind farms (which were incorrectly reported by Ofgem), integrated further meta-data for each farm (the geographical location, wind turbine model and hub height), and extended the time-series by 8 months, adding data from April to December 2012.</text></s>
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met12" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Our modified dataset is provided as Supplementary Material to this paper.</text></s>
<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met13" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>It contains 1687 farm-years of load factor data, covering onshore turbines built from 1991 onwards and spanning 11 years of operation.</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met14" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The study was restricted to onshore wind farms, as only a small amount of data was available for the UK's 20 offshore farms, and these would need to be considered separately as they face a very different operating environment and maintenance issues to onshore farms.</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Table 1 and Fig. 1 provide a selection of summary statistics for the data.</text></s>

<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs4" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Fig. 2 simply plots the distribution of all observed load factors against age, showing a steady decline of -0.44 ± 0.04 absolute percentage points per year past age one (1.69 ± 0.17% loss per year relative to the UK mean load factor).</text></s>
<s sid="75"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met15" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>As explained in the introduction this is not necessarily due to ageing if newer turbine models are more efficient at extracting energy from the wind.</text></s>
<s sid="76"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met16" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The oldest turbines in the sample (aged 15-19 years) were built in the early- to mid-1990s; typically 300-500 kW two or three bladed machines on 25-50 m towers.</text></s>
<s sid="77"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met17" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>These will clearly be outperformed by the latest generation of 2-3 MW turbines which are no older than 5 years.</text></s>

<s sid="79"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs5" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Load factors tend to rise during the first year of operation while turbines are still being commissioned until the farm achieves full operation and teething problems are ironed out.</text></s>

<s sid="81"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met19" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The areas with the darkest shading are derived from farms which are old enough to give ten years of data; lighter areas add the more recent farms which have fewer observations.</text></s>
<s sid="82"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The degradation rates of individual farms are predominantly bunched around 0 to -1 percentage points of absolute load factor per year, but several outliers make the overall distribution fat-tailed.</text></s>
<s sid="83"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A Cauchy (or Lorentz) distribution therefore provides a better fit than a normal distribution, centred on -0.48 with a half width at half maximum of 0.36.</text></s>
<s sid="84"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res21" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The distribution becomes wider for farms with fewer observations; and would stretch all the way from -25 to +15 points per year if farms with less than five years' data were included.</text></s>
<s sid="85"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res22" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>With an absolute degradation rate of -0.48 ± 0.36 points per year, a typical wind farm loses 1.81 ± 1.32% of its output per year on average.</text></s>

NASA wind speed data

<s sid="220"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res98" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>From Fig. 11a it can be seen that the uncertainty on the age fixed effects is small enough to be confident that there is indeed degradation, but is too large to be able to discern whether the trend beyond age 1 is linear, exponential, or some more complex function.</text></s>
<s sid="221"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res99" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For simplicity's sake we fit a linear trend to these effects, which falls from 28.5% at age 1 to the national average load factor of 26.3% for farms at the national average age (5.9 years), reaching 21.0% for the oldest farms aged 19.</text></s>

Discussion
<s sid="229"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res105" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The finding that wind turbines lose around 1.6% of their output each year poses three questions:1.</text></s>
<s sid="230"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res106" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>What are the reasons for this deterioration?</text></s>
2.
<s sid="231"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp4" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>Can we expect it to continue in future?</text></s>
3.
<s sid="232"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res107" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>What are its wider impacts?</text></s>
Reasons for declining output
<s sid="233"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res108" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The degradation rate we observe is perhaps to be expected, as it lies in the middle of the range experienced by gas turbine technologies: 0.75-2.25% per year [2].</text></s>
<s sid="234"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>As with gas turbines and other aerodynamic rotating machinery, a portion of the unrecoverable loss could be attributed to gradual deterioration, such as fouling of the blades (which will impede the aerodynamic performance) and a gradual reduction in component efficiencies (gearbox, bearings, generator).</text></s>
<s sid="235"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These may not be recoverable by maintenance procedures, but only by component replacement.</text></s>
<s sid="236"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>A (potentially larger) contribution could come from availability declining with age, either because older turbines fail more frequently or because they take longer to bring back online.</text></s>
<s sid="237"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Possible reasons for the latter are the likelihood that older machines suffer more serious failures, difficulty in obtaining components for obsolete models, and operators being less likely to hold comprehensive maintenance contracts.</text></s>
<s sid="238"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con19" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Availability will depend on the amount of effort the owner is willing to invest in maintenance, which may naturally fall over time as the asset is paid down, and will depend on electricity prices and O&amp;M costs.</text></s>
<s sid="239"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con20" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The manufacturer's availability warranty provided with a new turbine (which may for example guarantee 97% uptime) is also likely to exceed the standard provided by third party O&amp;M providers in later life.</text></s>
<s sid="240"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res109" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Early turbine death is a third contributing reason.</text></s>
<s sid="241"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res110" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>If one turbine in a farm of four fails completely at age 17, the farm will continue operating at a maximum of 75% of its original load factor, which would translate to an annualised degradation rate of around 1.6%.</text></s>
<s sid="242"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res111" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Fig. 9a highlights these first two reasons as a gradual downwards slope in the bulk of weather-corrected load factor observations, and isolated periods of very low output due to downtime which are concentrated towards higher ages.</text></s>
<s sid="243"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs29" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Fig. 3a shows an example of the third: Blyth Harbour stands out at the lower-right of the chart as its load factor declined from 12% to just 2% between the ages of 12 and 17.</text></s>
<s sid="244"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs30" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>By the end of its life only one of the nine turbines was generating, giving it the worst degradation rate of the farms we observed.</text></s>
Future trends
<s sid="245"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res112" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>What of the future? Although our main calculations are based on linear rates of decline, we cannot yet know if this assumption is correct.</text></s>
Figs.
<s sid="246"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res113" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>9b and 11a suggest a slightly lower rate of ageing in the first six or seven years of a farm's life.</text></s>
<s sid="247"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res114" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This early period is typically covered by comprehensive warranties which guarantee near-maximal output, whereas older farms may be less intensively maintained and thus deteriorate more rapidly.</text></s>
<s sid="248"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs31" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The pattern seen in these Figures could be produced if all turbines (of whatever cohort) had an initial period of slow decline, followed by accelerating degradation as they become older.</text></s>
<s sid="249"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp5" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>Alternatively, it could be that advances in technology mean that recent turbines experience relatively little decline and will continue to do so in the future, whereas earlier models have declined relatively faster throughout their lives.</text></s>
<s sid="250"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res115" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>As those early turbines were new in the 1990s their output is not available in our dataset, and so the experience of those years does not show up in Figs.</text></s>
9b and 11a.
<s sid="251"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res116" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>If those early turbines had declined rapidly when new, the kink visible in these Figures would have been lessened or even removed.</text></s>
<s sid="252"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res117" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Although the improvement in WCLF decline rates seen in farms commissioned after 2003 is statistically significant, that is no guarantee that this result will still hold if we were to repeat this study in a few years' time.</text></s>
<s sid="253"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con21" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Based on this, and further analysis in Supplementary Section 5.5, we must conclude that even though the initial signs are good, more data are required before we could say for sure that modern turbines are declining less rapidly than earlier cohorts.</text></s>
Wider impacts
<s sid="254"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res118" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The cumulative lifetime output of a 100 MW wind farm with a 28.5% load factor would be 4.99 TWh over 20 years.</text></s>
<s sid="255"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res119" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>If this farm suffers a linear annual deterioration of -0.41 points after the first year, its lifetime output reduces to 4.37 TWh, a fall of 12.5%.</text></s>
<s sid="256"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This will increase the cost of electricity from wind generators, as less electricity is produced to recover the costs of construction.</text></s>
<s sid="257"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The economic value of the lost output is relatively low as it mostly occurs in the far future.</text></s>
<s sid="258"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>With a discount rate of 10%, degradation increases the levelised cost of electricity by 9%, from approximately £90 [4,5] to £98 per MWh.</text></s>
<s sid="259"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con25" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This impact becomes greater if the economic lifetime increases or the discount rate decreases.</text></s>
<s sid="260"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con26" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>A second impact is that more capacity will need to be installed to produce a given level of output.</text></s>
<s sid="261"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con27" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The UK has a target for energy production from renewable sources (15% of all final energy by 2020), as opposed to a target for peak capacity.</text></s>
<s sid="262"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con28" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>If turbine build rates peak in the coming years, the average age of the UK's wind farms will creep upwards, and so the output from a fixed capacity can be expected to decline.</text></s>
<s sid="263"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con29" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>For every year the fleet ages, an additional 435 MW (4 large farms) would need to be brought online to maintain the original capacity of the UK's anticipated 30 GW fleet.</text></s>
Conclusions
<s sid="264"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con30" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This paper demonstrates a generic and broadly applicable method for predicting a wind farm's monthly load factor, accounting for its location, hub height and the particular model of turbine installed.</text></s>
<s sid="265"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con31" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We use this to estimate the ideal monthly load factors for 282 of the UK's wind farms over the last decade, and compare these to the actual outputs over this period.</text></s>
<s sid="266"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con32" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This allows us to correct for the rapid improvement in wind turbine technology over the last two decades and the huge seasonal variability in wind speeds, thus revealing the subtle rate of degradation.</text></s>
<s sid="267"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res120" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We find evidence of important, but not disastrous, performance degradation over time in a large sample of UK wind farms.</text></s>
<s sid="268"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res121" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>When variations in the weather and improvement in turbine design are accounted for, we find that the load factors of UK wind farms fall by 1.57% (0.41 percentage points) per year.</text></s>
<s sid="269"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res122" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This degradation rate appears consistent for different vintages of turbines and for individual wind farms, ranging from those built in the early 1990s to early 2010s.</text></s>
<s sid="270"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res123" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We use six methods of increasing complexity to find the following rates of degradation in absolute percentage points per year; and relative to the UK mean wind farm:•</text></s>

<s sid="277"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res130" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The combined average of these measures is -0.43 ± 0.05 percentage points per year, giving -1.6 ± 0.2% annual degradation.</text></s>
<s sid="278"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con33" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The similarity of results from different methods gives us confidence that the underlying trend is robust: the decline in load factor with age is neither an artefact of systematic variation in wind speeds nor of the continual improvement in technology.</text></s>
<s sid="279"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con34" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Questions do however remain as to the exact form of this degradation, for example whether it is linear, quadratic or logarithmic with age; or how degradation rates are changing over time and whether they will be lower in the future.</text></s>
<s sid="280"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con35" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Access to data from more farms, and a more detailed wind resource assessment for each site will be fundamental to furthering our understanding of these issues.</text></s>
<s sid="281"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con36" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The level of degradation we find is not insignificant, yet it is not unusual compared to conventional generation technologies.</text></s>
<s sid="282"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con37" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The fact that it has been omitted from calculations of the levelised cost of electricity from wind means that these estimates are around 9% below the true value (depending on assumed discount rate and economic lifetime).</text></s>
<s sid="283"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con38" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This is unlikely to be large enough to change the business case for wind power, but nonetheless it needs to be accounted for to give an accurate picture of its cost.</text></s>
