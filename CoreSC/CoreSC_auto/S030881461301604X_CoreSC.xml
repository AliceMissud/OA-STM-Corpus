Introduction
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Arsenic is a metalloid with a ubiquitous presence; it occurs in rock, soil, water, air and living organisms in inorganic and organic forms (Mandal &amp; Suzuki, 2002; Naja &amp; Volesky, 2009).</text></s>

<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Generally speaking, inorganic arsenic compounds are more toxic than organic ones, and the trivalent arsenic form is more toxic than its pentavalent equivalent (Hughes, 2002).</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>It is difficult to determine the individual arsenic species in order of their toxicity, because the toxicity of these chemical forms is very different not only in different organisms but even between organs.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>One factor that makes arsenic more interesting is that arsenic is an essential element for some animals, like rats and goats (Püssa, 2008; Ratnaike, 2003) and interindividual susceptibility in humans to the adverse effects caused by arsenic compounds has been reported (Huang et al., 2004).</text></s>

Discussion
<s sid="159"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>One of the major advantages of our method is that it permits quantification of inorganic arsenic or arsenic species in everyday routine analysis.</text></s>
<s sid="160"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con6" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Many methods developed in arsenic speciation are only applicable for research purposes.</text></s>
<s sid="161"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs13" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The disadvantages of using carbonate buffers as an eluents are long retention time and the peak broadening with arsenate (Raber et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="162"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con7" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These are due to high pH which leads to additional deprotonation of the arsenate anion.</text></s>
<s sid="163"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con8" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Irrespective of these problems, one achieves good repeatability and reproducibility with this method (Table 1).</text></s>
<s sid="164"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con9" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>One interesting observation is that reproducibility improves from the first day to the third day of analysis which may be a result of the gradual accommodation of the instrumentation to the HPLC-ICP-MS-mode.</text></s>
<s sid="165"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con10" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thus, we estimate that the reproducibility of the method would be around 4% if a dedicated HPLC-ICP-MS instrument could be used.</text></s>
<s sid="166"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con11" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Furthermore, trueness of the method is very good with regard to the validation data as well as from the results from several interlaboratory comparisons.</text></s>
<s sid="167"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con12" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The analysis time is 45min which can be considered as long.</text></s>
<s sid="168"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con13" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However the overall analysis time is not so long because the extraction time is short and sample preparation is fast and robust.</text></s>
<s sid="169"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met21" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The method takes a full advantage of specificity and no interfering signals to the five standard compounds used was detected in any of the samples analysed so far.</text></s>
<s sid="170"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con14" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The method worked perfectly also for the samples which included also other ingredients.</text></s>
<s sid="171"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In general the total and inorganic arsenic contents of rice-based baby food are lower than the levels in long grain rice.</text></s>
<s sid="172"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>One of the reasons for the lower total arsenic levels in these products compared to long grain rice is that they include other foodstuffs, for example fruits and whey and milk powder which dilute the sample.</text></s>
<s sid="173"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Only two out of ten baby cereal products had the exact relative amount of rice declared on the label.</text></s>
<s sid="174"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Three products which had rice as the main ingredient (rice was mentioned first in the ingredient list) had the highest total arsenic content detected in this study.</text></s>
<s sid="175"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con19" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>For this reason, it is reasonable to conclude that when rice powder is the main ingredient of baby food, the arsenic content is higher than in products which have some other cereals or milk to dilute the amount of rice.</text></s>
<s sid="176"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con20" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Therefore it is possible to recommend that there should be &quot;dilution&quot; of the rice powder with some other healthy ingredient low in its inorganic arsenic level to lower the overall arsenic intake.</text></s>
<s sid="177"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con21" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This is particularly true in countries with high consumption of rice based baby food.</text></s>
<s sid="178"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Some assessments of the inorganic arsenic intake from long grain rice and baby food can be made (Table 4).</text></s>
<s sid="179"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>All the estimations are conservative, worst case scenarios and conducted using the products that contained the highest inorganic arsenic levels (long grain rice 0.28mg/kg and porridge powder 0.21mg/kg) and the lowest BMDL0.1 level 0.3μg/kg bw/day evaluated by EFSA.</text></s>
<s sid="180"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The consumption of long grain rice is around 66g/day in women (25 - 64years) and 80g/day in men (25-64years), respectively.</text></s>
<s sid="181"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res46" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The average consumption figures would result in inorganic arsenic intakes of 0.26μg/kg (women) and 0.27μg/kg (men) bw/day.</text></s>
<s sid="182"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res47" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In the worst case scenarios the levels of inorganic arsenic intake for the four groups was above the lower limit of the benchmark dose needed for a 0.1% increased incidence of various cancer types and skin lesions.</text></s>
<s sid="183"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res48" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The inorganic arsenic intake of different age groups of children from rice-based baby food was also close to the lower BMDL0.1 value.</text></s>
<s sid="184"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con25" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Our data indicates also, that the cumulative inorganic arsenic intake in different age groups should be assessed.</text></s>
Conclusions

<s sid="188"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con29" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In particular, these experiments provide additional information on the relationship between total and inorganic arsenic levels as well as their correlations as evaluated in rice-based baby foods which are very popular in Europe.</text></s>
<s sid="189"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con30" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is notable that five of the products analysed exceeded the limit set by People's Republic of China for inorganic arsenic in rice.</text></s>
<s sid="190"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con31" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Due to the fact that the intake figures are around the lower BMDL0.1 value in all age groups even though only the intake of inorganic arsenic from rice-based baby food and long grain rice was evaluated, the future goal will be the cumulative intake assessment of inorganic arsenic in different age groups.</text></s>
