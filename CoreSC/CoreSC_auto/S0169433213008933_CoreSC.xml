<s sid="92"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We did not encounter issues with sublimation during heating possibly due to the fact that the film is partially cross-linked already at room temperature.</text></s>
<s sid="93"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj9" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The fully cross-linked HSQ film on the metal substrate is capable of and has been tested to withstand more than 10,000 injection molding cycles, when applied on the metal mold insert.</text></s>

<s sid="95"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj11" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>We characterized coated and uncoated surfaces with AFM and an optical profiler.</text></s>

<s sid="97"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res32" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For the 3-D optical profiler measurements on surfaces coated with the cured HSQ films it was necessary to sputter a thin layer of a reflective film in order to characterize roughness of HSQ coated surfaces.</text></s>
<s sid="98"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res33" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This is essential as the HSQ film alone is transparent, and has, according to the literature [29], a relatively low refractive index of about 1.36-1.39.</text></s>
<s sid="99"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res34" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Hence, HSQ only reflects approximately 2.4-2.7% of incident light, assuming perpendicular incidence and no roughness.</text></s>
<s sid="100"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This, together with an uneven, rough and highly reflective metallic substrate surface under the HSQ prevents reliable optical characterization without metallization.</text></s>
<s sid="101"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con3" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Neither the HSQ film thickness nor the surface topography/roughness can be reliably measured without metallization.</text></s>
<s sid="102"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, when sputtering of a thin, reflective layer of metal on top of the HSQ, we can increase reflectance to well over 50% without altering the surface topography significantly.</text></s>
<s sid="103"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Using Fresnel equations and optical constants from literature [33,34] we can easily calculate that, for instance, as little as 14nm of gold gives a perpendicular reflectance R=0.51 for a wavelength of 500nm, which is sufficient for characterization using an optical profiler and the vertical scan interference method.</text></s>
<s sid="104"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res35" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>One should note that the optical constants of an extremely thin (less than 15nm) metallic film differ slightly from the properties of the bulk metal [35,36] and that they usually form islands and voids instead of a continuous film.</text></s>
<s sid="105"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs5" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>We can see this effect in the FIB-SEM profile micrographs, shown as Fig. 5, where the non-continuous metal film is seen as the uppermost layer.</text></s>
<s sid="106"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs6" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Therefore we sputtered thin reflective films not only on HSQ coated samples but also on silicon wafer samples, to verify the topography change due to the sputtering of a reflective film.</text></s>
<s sid="107"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs7" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>We observed that a pristine silicon wafer sample shows root mean square roughness SRMS of 2.4±0.3nm while a sputter coated wafer with gold-palladium reflective film shows SRMS of 1.96±0.2nm, and the peak-to-valley roughnesses are 16±2.30nm and 13.6±1.6nm respectively.</text></s>
<s sid="108"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res36" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We can see that the topography change due to sputtering of a reflective film is indeed very small (see Supplementary Table S1) thus the effect is negligible.</text></s>
<s sid="109"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res37" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This finally allows surface topography measurement on HSQ coated substrates using a 3-D optical profilometer, as shown in Fig. 4.</text></s>
<s sid="110"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod2" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Areal roughness parameters, root mean square (RMS) roughness (SRMS) and the roughness average (Sa) are defined as the average of the height deviations and the mean surface (quadratic mean), and the arithmetic average (mean) of the 3-D roughness, taken over the evaluation area, therefore they are statistical parameters, and we present them in Figs.</text></s>

<s sid="112"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs8" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>We see substantial decrease of roughness on the HSQ coated samples; approximately 10 times for a sample with initially higher roughness and 3 times for a sample with initially lower roughness.</text></s>
<s sid="113"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res39" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For the peak-to-valley roughness (SPV), defined as being the distance from the highest to the lowest point in the evaluation area, the decrease is the most dramatic one, as shown Fig. 2.</text></s>
<s sid="114"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res40" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We see a more than 20 times lower value for the sample with a higher starting roughness and a more than 10 times lower value for the paste polished sample with a lower starting roughness.</text></s>
<s sid="115"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res41" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Despite the fact that the peak-to-valley roughness is the one most affected by the region-of-interest-selection, and unlike the roughness average and the root mean square roughness it is not a statistically robust parameter, it is a very a important parameter since it dominates the sample appearance, the optical properties and the perception of quality.</text></s>
<s sid="116"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con6" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Even samples with decent, fairly low Sa and SRMS can easily be ruined by a few deep scratches, thus, the reduction of the peak-to-valley roughness is a very important effect.</text></s>
