<s sid="6"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>It is shown that there are five main contributors to differences in energy delivery and the magnitude of these depends on the environments in which the devices are operated.</text></s>

Introduction
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj6" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The most critical factor determining the suitability of deploying photovoltaics is the cost of energy, or service, delivered and not the power rating of the devices.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Energy is a commodity and thus the aim is to generate electrical energy, or services, as cheaply as possible.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj7" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>There are two major contributors to the final cost of electricity produced by a system: its specific energy yield and the costs of purchase, operation and maintenance.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj8" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>This paper concentrates on the first, the specific energy yield.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj9" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The focus is on thin film technologies, namely different modules produced from amorphous silicon (a-Si) and Copper Indium Gallium Diselenide (CIGS), in particular on the energy yields of these devices which are susceptible to variations in the operating environment, have a wider design window and less availability of field experience data than conventional wafer-based crystalline silicon (c-Si) devices.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj10" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>There are a large number of performance studies reported, some with the aim of understanding the behaviour of a single type of device and some to compare the energy yields of different devices.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>This paper focuses on behaviour at module level, which may be built up to include system effects such as mismatch, interconnection and power conversion components.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp1" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>PV modules are normally labelled with a power rating, which means the power measured at standard test conditions, STC, as defined in [1].</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This is called peak-power, denoted as Wp.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>STC represent rather favourable operating conditions for most PV technologies as it is an unrealistic combination of a cold module temperature (25°C) at a high irradiance (1000W/m2).</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Different modules, even of the same technology, generally have different rated powers and the energy yields must be made comparable in any inter-comparison study.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj11" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>This is achieved by using the specific yield (kWh/kWp).</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj12" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The specific yield is a key property of PV modules at a particular location and can be a major sales argument for competing PV module suppliers.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj13" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Many manufacturers use energy yield measurements to show the quality of their modules against those of competitors, see e.g.</text></s>
[2].
Some organisations, e.g.
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj14" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Photon, provide purportedly independent advice via the comparison of modules.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj15" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>There are also many independent investigations carried out by research institutes, e.g.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj16" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>[3-10], which also provide data sources to compare the energy yield of different technologies.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj17" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The discussion is then often focussed on the determination of the 'best' technology and generalised claims on technologies are made as e.g.</text></s>
in [11].
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa3" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The aim in the following is to show technology-specific differences, but does not claim to identify the 'best' technology or superior devices, since this tends to be specific to each installation.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>It is also shown that the differences between different devices within any thin-film technology group are so significant that it is virtually impossible to make a decision of which technology to use in a system purely on the basis of material.</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The following demonstrates the differences in long term performance of different PV technologies, where 7 modules have been operated for more than 5 years in the current measurement system, with some having been operated for several years previously on another measurement system.</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot4" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>The analysis is of the key influences on energy delivery of these specific devices and is not meant as a generalisation for any of the technologies in the test.</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj18" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In the case of amorphous silicon devices, the device structure, number of junctions, material of the junctions as well as manufacturing can impact on the energy yield significantly [12,13].</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Similar differences are seen in the case of polycrystalline thin film devices [14].</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These issues can be due to different manufacturing techniques or different device structures, where in the case of CdTe, for example, different window layers can result in significantly different quantum efficiencies [15].</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot5" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>The number of design parameters of thin film devices is larger and the production processes are less standardised than for c-Si, resulting in wide variation in the specific energy yield of modules of the same material technology.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa4" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>One of the aims of this paper is to demonstrate the difference between optimisation for high module power and high specific yield.</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Optimisation for energy yield may not coincide with optimisation for STC rated power.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs3" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>As an example, the performance of a crystalline (c-Si) module is shown in Fig. 1 for a number of locations.</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj19" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>A c-Si example is chosen because the performance of these devices is generally more familiar.</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj20" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The data used here is a matrix measurement as specified in [16] and the energy yield is calculated utilising an implementation of the proposed energy rating standard [17].</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs4" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The effects of doubling the series resistance or halving the temperature coefficient are shown.</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The modifications are applied to the power measurement matrix and the annual energy yield for a number of locations is calculated by drawing on local meteorological data sets, as indicated on the map in Fig. 1.</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The overlay boxes indicate the specific yields and performance ratios for the different modules (described in the box in the centre of the graph entitled 'key').</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met5" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The effects of the modifications in series resistance and temperature coefficients on the specific energy yield depend on the particular location environments and the device responses relative to STC.</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A practical example of such a modification is the number of front contact bus bars on wafer based technologies, e.g.</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res4" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>changing from a two-bus bar design to a three-bus bar design for larger cells.</text></s>
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The sub-optimal design, i.e. the one with two bus bars which causes a higher series resistance and thus high ohmic losses, typically has a lower power at STC but may have a higher specific energy yield than those with three bus bars due to relatively higher efficiency at lower irradiances.</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This is illustrated in Fig. 1 where the high resistance case delivers more energy for all sites but those with the highest annual irradiation.</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Thus the 'worse' device delivers a higher specific energy in the majority of locations.</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Similarly, an elevated temperature coefficient will have different effects in different locations, with relatively modest effects in cool to temperate climates.</text></s>
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It can be seen that in certain environments the ranking in terms of performance ratio or specific energy yield changes for the different series resistances assumed or temperature coefficients.</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The analogous situation to the variation in series resistance for thin films would be for e.g.</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs5" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>the width of a cell (see e.g.</text></s>
<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs6" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>[18]) or the change in the thickness of the transparent conducting oxide or any other factor that affects the series resistance in the cell.</text></s>
<s sid="63"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs7" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The cell geometry is crucial for thin film devices as it can change the series resistance and fill factor significantly [19].</text></s>
<s sid="64"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs8" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The thickness (depth) of the device affects optical absorption but also degradation.</text></s>
<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs9" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Different window layers modify the spectral response and some devices undergo a shunt busting treatment, where all shunt paths are burnt out.</text></s>
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Similarly, the temperature coefficient of more tuneable technology families such as CIGS can be influenced by the composition ratio of indium and gallium, i.e. a change of band gap, or simply material quality.</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This demonstrates the earlier point that devices of nominally the same material can have very different energy yields, which also needs to be considered in the context of the operating environment, and that one should not over-generalise for technologies.</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa5" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The aim in the following is thus to derive some general factors, which excludes device specifics and gives an estimated ranking of the importance of the different effects on the performance, thus identifying the optimisation potential for future devices.</text></s>
Accuracy of measurement inter-comparisons
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met6" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The accuracy of a measurement campaign depends strongly on the purpose of the experiment.</text></s>
<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met7" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>It was already pointed out that many studies are carried out to quantify environmental effects for specific devices.</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In these studies only relative changes are required, i.e. device behaviour under different conditions is normalised to its own performance at STC.</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This has a different accuracy as compared to an inter-comparison between different devices.</text></s>
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con3" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In these studies, any difference in performance between devices must be larger than the uncertainty of the measurement in order to be statistically meaningful and thus these boundaries are explored before presenting the actual performance data.</text></s>
<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Inter-comparison studies typically report kWh/kWp, sometimes with differences resolved to several decimal points, which is on figures typically in the range of 1000kWh/kWp.</text></s>
<s sid="75"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This is not significant, yet it is rare to find any consideration of measurement uncertainty which would clearly show this level of reporting.</text></s>
<s sid="76"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met8" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The uncertainty in the specific energy yield is split into two parts, the actual measurement of the energy yield and the determination of the power rating used for the normalisation.</text></s>
<s sid="77"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met9" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The former are typically in the range 1-2% [3,20,21], depending on whether the calibrations of electronic measurements were carried out using the same traceability chain or not.</text></s>
<s sid="78"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met10" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Not many uncertainty calculations to date take low signal strength into account, which increases electrical measurement uncertainty significantly [22] and thus should be included.</text></s>
<s sid="79"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met11" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The determination of kWp is typically carried out indoors using solar simulator and often involves a much higher uncertainty.</text></s>
<s sid="80"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met12" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This depends on the quality of the measurement system used for the characterisation, the PV material and device structure, appropriate reference devices and, significantly, on the competence of the measurement agent.</text></s>
<s sid="81"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs10" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>A summary of the different characterisation issues is given in Table 1.</text></s>
<s sid="82"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Good review articles on general measurement issues have been recently published covering most of these in depth [23,24].</text></s>
<s sid="83"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The achievable uncertainty in Table 1 is estimated based on the review articles as well as an analysis of published round robin measurements [25,26].</text></s>
<s sid="84"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These considerations mean that the specific energy yields of thin film devices have 5-7% uncertainty attached to them, if carried out with the same traceability chain.</text></s>
<s sid="85"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, many inter-comparisons are conducted without measuring the power ratings of the specific modules within the test.</text></s>
<s sid="86"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Then the module selection becomes crucial [21] as well as the variability of the modules within the supplier power bin.</text></s>
<s sid="87"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This can be ∼10% for thin film modules, although some manufacturers have tighter binning in their production.</text></s>
<s sid="88"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In the case of unmeasured modules it would be a reasonable approximation to attribute a 10-15% uncertainty in the yield inter-comparison of modules.</text></s>
<s sid="89"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res21" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The measurement uncertainty is such a key factor in any inter-comparison [21] on system level are dominated by it [27].</text></s>
<s sid="90"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res22" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In conclusion, it should be kept in mind that the overall experimental design and the power rating dominate the reliability of any inter-comparison [11,21].</text></s>
Data schedule
<s sid="91"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj21" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The effects of the environment on device operation are investigated in this paper based on long term measurements carried out at Loughborough University's Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology (CREST).</text></s>
<s sid="92"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met13" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The measurements were taken using the COMS-3 (generation 3 of the CREST Outdoor Measurement System) [28], which are based on the roof of the Sir David Davies Building of Loughborough University.</text></s>

Effects of the environment

<s sid="241"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con45" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This seems to be indicating that especially in the case of a-Si, there is an increasing influence of seasonal material changes affecting device performance, i.e. the magnitude of the performance swing due to seasonal annealing and degradation is increasing and the matching of the junctions might be closer, thus the changes affect the short circuit current more.</text></s>
<s sid="242"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con46" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The extremely wide distributions of the multi-junction devices are due to different junction matching in the wide spectral ranges observed at Loughborough [54].</text></s>
<s sid="243"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con47" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The ageing of devices affects the energy yield significantly.</text></s>
<s sid="244"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con48" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Assuming that the degradation rate is maintained at the given rate, the overall power degradation of the devices with the minimum/maximum degradation over a 20-year module lifetime is 3%/35% respectively.</text></s>
<s sid="245"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con49" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The losses in annual energy generation are even higher for the majority of devices, leading to difference between the lifetime specific energy yield of different devices as much as 25%, assuming 25 year warranties, the current standard.</text></s>

Conclusions
<s sid="247"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con51" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The energy generation of a number of different photovoltaic materials has been reviewed based on long term measurements carried out at CREST.</text></s>
Six modules are reviewed.
<s sid="248"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con52" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is demonstrated that it is not realistic to make global statements for specific technologies as different devices tend to have different behaviours in terms of response to the environment as well as in terms of energy delivery and stability.</text></s>
<s sid="249"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con53" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is shown that the effect of irradiance on device performance is largely due to device design, while the temperature and spectral response are dominated by the band gap and material quality of the absorber layer.</text></s>
<s sid="250"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con54" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is shown that the different environmental effects do not contribute more than 15% losses to the annual yield even in different locations.</text></s>
<s sid="251"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con55" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The precise allocation of effects varies in different climates, with maritime climates at mid- to high-latitude such as the UK having high performance ratios.</text></s>
<s sid="252"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con56" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is demonstrated that when the energy yield of a module should be investigated either through modelling or through measurements, the long term behaviour can have a much more significant influence on the device productivity than the effect of the environment.</text></s>
<s sid="253"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con57" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>A variation of 25% in life-time energy yield variations is possible.</text></s>
<s sid="254"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con58" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Currently much less is known about the impact of the environment on ageing than directly on the instantaneous performance.</text></s>
<s sid="255"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con59" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In terms of bankability of the modules, this appears to be a dangerous oversight as this may have a much higher effect on the profitability of a system than, for example, the response to operating temperature.</text></s>
<s sid="256"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con60" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is shown that as soon as more than a single module is to be considered, one needs to include the measurement accuracy of the device characterisation into consideration to assure that any inter-comparisons result in reliable and useful numbers.</text></s>
<s sid="257"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con61" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is also argued that sub-percentage deviations in the energy yield are not meaningful in the context of this uncertainty.</text></s>
<s sid="258"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con62" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In the case of inter-comparisons the magnitude of uncertainty hidden in the module measurement is larger than any single environmental effect.</text></s>
