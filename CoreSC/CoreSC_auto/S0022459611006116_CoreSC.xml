Introduction
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Metal nitride fluorides are a relatively unexplored class of inorganic materials [1,2].</text></s>

<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The first examples of these were magnesium nitride fluorides prepared by Andersson [4,5] and three phases were reported which had structures related to the rocksalt structure of MgO.</text></s>

<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>L-Mg2NF, a low temperature polymorph, is tetragonal with ordered anions and contains magnesium in square-pyramidal co-ordination.</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The high temperature polymorph, H-Mg2NF, is observed after treating L-Mg2NF at high temperature and pressure (1100-1350°C; 25-30kbar).</text></s>
