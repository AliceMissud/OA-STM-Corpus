Introduction
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>If a site for a turbine is bounded by rigid walls, the walls will affect the character of the flow and thereby the performance of the turbine.</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj1" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>One example is a river, where the net flow between impermeable river banks is constant.</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj2" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In this case, the flow boundaries increase turbine performance [1,2].</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The same holds for experimental tests in wind tunnels and towing tanks etc.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj4" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Another example is flow generated by tides in a river mouth.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod1" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Here, the flow resistance caused by the turbines can decrease the total flow through the channel and reduce power production [3].</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod2" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>A final example is flow with artificial walls created in open sea.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod3" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Here, the flow has the possibility to pass around the walls, and the fluid motion between the channel walls depends on the flow resistance of the turbine.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj5" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>This case has been studied in Refs.</text></s>
[4-6] and elsewhere.
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj6" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The present study only covers the first case, where the total flow in the channel is constant.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj7" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Apart from building turbines in confined areas, the study of turbines inside a channel is also important from a simulation point of view.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj8" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>For simulations based on volume discretization, e.g.</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj9" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>FEM, walls in the simulation domain are introduced.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj10" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>If these walls are located too close to the turbine, the computed performance will be incorrect.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj11" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>This article is intended to be useful both for designers of turbines in channels and for those involved with simulations of turbines.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj12" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In this study, straight bladed vertical axis turbines are investigated.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>For a simple and robust turbine design, only turbines with a fixed blade pitch angle are studied.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Vertical axis turbines are typically simulated with either streamtube models, vortex models or CFD models based on volume discretization.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met5" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Since the traditional streamtube models [7,8], only work for free flow, this is not an option for channel flow.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met6" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The choice therefore stands between vortex methods, which in their basic forms are best suited for free flows, and CFD models, which due to the volume discretization always are accompanied by channel effects.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met7" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>To study the channel effects properly, many simulations have to be performed.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met8" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Therefore, a computationally efficient method is required, and vortex method simulations are generally faster than CFD models.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met9" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>For this reason, the vortex method is chosen for the current study.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met10" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>To further reduce the computational time, only 2D simulations are performed, which is a reasonably realistic model for a vertical axis turbine.</text></s>
The vortex method
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met11" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Vortex methods are based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, but instead of using the velocity as the main variable, the vorticity (i.e. the curl of the velocity) is chosen.</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met12" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The vorticity field is discretized in a grid-free manner using point vortices.</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In the vorticity formulation, the vorticity is a conserved quantity, which can only be created at the boundaries and will move with the flow velocity.</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Vortex methods are well documented in literature and for a more detailed description of the general theory, see for example Ref. [9].</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>There have been several implementations of the vortex method for vertical axis turbines.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met13" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>For wind turbines, Strickland implemented the method to study the curved bladed turbine 1979 [10].</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met14" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>More recent implementations of vortex methods include the three-dimensional panel implementation by Dixon et al. [11] and the two-dimensional implementation by Deglaire et al. [12], which is based on conformal mappings instead of a panel method.</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met15" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>One can also note the two-dimensional double wake model by Zanon et al. [13], where the leading edge separation point is determined through a boundary layer model and one additional vortex is released at each time step to create this leading edge separation.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met16" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This makes the model suitable for dynamic stall simulations.</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met17" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The two-dimensional vortex method has also been combined with a finite element method by Ponta and Jacovkis [14], where the finite element method is used to calculate the flow close to the blade and the vortex method is used to calculate the wake.</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met18" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The vortex method has been used for tidal turbines by e.g.</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod4" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Wang et al. [15], where the model uses a panel method for the potential flow and compensates for friction drag through a boundary layer model.</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod5" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Other notable work includes the work of Li and Çalişal [16], which is based on empirical values for the lift and drag coefficients, and this model also includes additional corrections for viscous effects, such as the decay of vortices.</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod6" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>All the above mentioned models have been free vortex models, where the vortices move with the flow.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod7" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>One other approach is taken by McCombes et al. [17].</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod8" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>In this three-dimensional model, the vorticity instead is modeled on an Eulerian mesh to obtain improved stability in the solution (although a traditional free vortex model is used in the close proximity of the blades).</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod9" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>This model is implemented through a finite volume version of the vorticity-velocity equation.</text></s>
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj13" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In this paper, a relatively simplified version of the vortex model will be used to ensure high computational efficiency.</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>One simplification is that the viscous effects in the wake regions can be neglected for high Reynolds numbers.</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This approximation seems reasonable in most regions of the flow, apart from the boundary layer region with its large velocity gradients.</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met19" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>A common approach is to assume that the inviscid approximation holds in the entire domain and use the Kutta condition [18] to calculate the circulation around the blade.</text></s>
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met20" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>A problem with this approach is that separation cannot be modeled, which means that stall phenomena are neglected.</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met21" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Another problem is that the drag force will be zero, which makes it difficult to estimate turbine efficiency.</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met22" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>To account for this problem, profile section data is used in the following way: First, the velocities at the boundary points are calculated from the vortices (a Gaussian smoothing kernel is used in all velocity evaluations [9]).</text></s>
<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met23" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>With the boundary velocities known, a linear vortex panel method is used to calculate the circulation around the blades by applying the Kutta condition (assuming zero panel vorticity at the trailing edge).</text></s>
<s sid="63"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met24" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>To translate this into an angle of attack, a lookup table is used.</text></s>
<s sid="64"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met25" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The lookup table is created by calculating the circulation for known angles of attack for a stationary blade in homogeneous flow.</text></s>
<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met26" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>With the angle of attack computed, the lift and drag coefficients are obtained from profile section data.</text></s>
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met27" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>With this method, a different lift coefficient is obtained than from the Kutta condition.</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met28" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>One additional equation is necessary to calculate the circulation from these new coefficients, and following the work of Strickland [10], the Kutta Joukowski lift formula is used.</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod10" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The change in circulation can be calculated as the difference in circulation from the previous time step, and a vortex with a strength corresponding to this change in circulation is released into the flow each time step.</text></s>
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod11" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The whole procedure is iterated to take into account that the released circulation changes the boundary velocity.</text></s>
<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod12" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>It is assumed that the blades are small in comparison to the whole turbine, and each blade is solved individually, where the other blades are approximated as point circulations.</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>One limit of this model is that profile section data has to be available.</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For the current blade, data is obtained from Ref.</text></s>
[19].
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For low tip speed ratios, the blades will enter the dynamic stall region.</text></s>
<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod13" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>To compensate for these effects, a model originally developed by Gormont [20] and later modified by Massé [21] is used.</text></s>
<s sid="75"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod14" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The current implementation uses the parameters suggested by Berg [22].</text></s>
<s sid="76"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod15" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The blades are assumed to have a high aspect ratio and no corrections due to 3D effects are performed.</text></s>
<s sid="77"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod16" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The Kutta condition is not satisfied with the reduced blade circulation, which corresponds to infinite flow velocity at the trailing edge.</text></s>
<s sid="78"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod17" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>To account for this, the blades are approximated as single point circulations during the vortex convection step to avoid problems at the trailing edge and to improve computational speed.</text></s>
<s sid="79"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod18" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Within this approximation, a few vortices may penetrate into the blade in the computational domain.</text></s>
<s sid="80"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod19" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Since this is unphysical, the contributions from these vortices are neglected during the calculation of the blade circulation while the vortices are inside the blade.</text></s>
Modeling channels
<s sid="81"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod20" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The velocity contribution (complex conjugated) from a vortex at position zj and with strength Γj in free flow is obtained at position z from(1)u(z)¯=-iΓj2π1z-zj,where the z and zj are complex numbers.</text></s>
<s sid="82"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod21" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>It is shown in Ref.</text></s>
<s sid="83"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod22" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>[23] that if the vortex is located in a channel with walls at Im(z) = 0 and Im(z) = W, equation (1) can be written as(2)u(z)¯=-iΓj2π(coth(σc(z-zj))-coth(σc(z-zj¯))),where(3)σc=π2W.</text></s>

<s sid="240"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con43" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This has been omitted in this study, as the size of the support structure will be a question of material properties and the nominal flow velocity.</text></s>
<s sid="241"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con44" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Since this support structure causes additional drag, the performance can be expected to decrease with increased tip speed ratio.</text></s>

<s sid="245"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con46" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>One explanation is that the vertical axis turbine cannot absorb optimum power over its entire cross-sectional area, but further validations are required to determine if this is the only reason for the lower simulated power coefficients compared to analytical theory.</text></s>

<s sid="249"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con50" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Note that the required number of revolutions for convergence varies substantially, depending on many parameters, such as the channel length, how much the turbine decreases the flow velocity etc.</text></s>
<s sid="250"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res83" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For the low tip speed ratio simulations, which have relatively low affect on the flow velocity through the turbine, it can be beneficial to check for convergence during the simulation and end the simulation as soon as convergence is detected, instead of running all simulations for a fixed large number of revolutions to ensure convergence.</text></s>
<s sid="251"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con51" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, as the solution may oscillate for the high tip speed ratio case, it is still recommended to limit the maximum allowed number of revolutions, as full convergence may not always be achieved.</text></s>

<s sid="253"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con53" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The values presented in this work should only serve as guidelines to how the convergence of the simulations is expected to behave.</text></s>
<s sid="254"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con54" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The convergence criterion used here is also relatively demanding, and if less accuracy is required, a smaller number of revolutions will be necessary.</text></s>
<s sid="255"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con55" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>For the design of the turbine, the simulations with higher solidities show that when designing a turbine for a channel, the optimal design will be different compared to the free flow case.</text></s>

Conclusions
<s sid="260"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res84" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The simulations show that a turbine in a channel experiences an increase in power coefficient compared to a turbine in a free flow and that the peak for the power coefficient occurs at a higher tip speed ratio.</text></s>
<s sid="261"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con60" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Compared to the idealized theoretical maximum for channels, the simulations show that the increase in performance due to the channel for a turbine optimized for free flow is smaller than the simple analytical expectation, and this difference increases with increased blockage ratio.</text></s>
<s sid="262"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con61" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The simulations also indicate that the turbine should be designed differently for the channel case.</text></s>
<s sid="263"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con62" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>For narrow channels, the solidity should be increased to improve the performance.</text></s>
<s sid="264"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res85" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This increased power with higher solidity is still limited at a blockage ratios of 12.5% (3% increase), although grows with increasing blockage ratio.</text></s>
<s sid="265"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con63" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This indicates that for blockage ratios higher than about 10%, the blockage ratio should be taken into account for the optimal turbine design.</text></s>
<s sid="266"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res86" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For the numerical part, it is seen that high blockage ratios give faster convergence, while for small blockage ratios, the number of revolutions until convergence is high and for wide channels, about 100 revolutions are required for convergence at the optimal tip speed ratio.</text></s>
<s sid="267"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con64" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This highlights the necessity to use fast numerical schemes to enable computations of sufficient numbers of revolutions in the case of small blockage ratios.</text></s>
