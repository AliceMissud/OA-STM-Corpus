Background
Regional setting
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The Indus Shelf, located in the northern Arabian Sea spans approximately 180km from the delta to the slope edge and stretches southeast from the Murray Ridge and Makran Coast to the Rann of Kutch in India (Fig. 1).</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The shelf is dominated by the submarine Indus delta and a large sinuous canyon structure, the Swatch (Giosan et al., 2006), separating the eastern and western shelves.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The Holocene delta is built over an 11km-thick passive margin sediment pile dating back to the Late Cretaceous and which has been the recipient of large volumes of sediment from the Indus River since at least the Early Miocene (Clift et al., 2001).</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The region is tectonically quiescent, except for the transform plate boundary to the west, along the Murray Ridge.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Sediment supply is dominantly from the Himalayas and Karakoram (Clift et al., 2004; Garzanti et al., 2005).</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Clay mineralogy and magnetic properties have been used to reconstruct palaeoenvironmental conditions and provenance of marine sediments throughout Asia (e.g., Bouquillon et al., 1989; Sirocko and Lange, 1991; Prins et al., 2000; Thamban et al., 2002; Boulay et al., 2005; Wan et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, these studies have often been focussed in deepwater settings, away from the influence of major river systems or sediment processes on high-energy shelves.</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The cores in this study are located only 20km away from the coast line in ~70m of water, and are strongly influenced by the Indus River as well as the high wave energy of the Indus Shelf.</text></s>

Clay mineralogy

<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Typically studies quantify changes in the relative abundances of kaolinite, chlorite, smectite and illite as weathering proxies.</text></s>

<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Indus River assemblages are dominated by smectite, illite and to a lesser extent chlorite (Rao and Rao, 1995; Alizai et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Smectite is a product of chemical weathering and its presence is typically associated with alteration of volcanic minerals (Chamley, 1989; Liu et al., 2003), although it also forms in low-lying poorly-drained soils (Wilson, 1999).</text></s>

<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac22" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Low illite crystallinity is associated with greater chemical weathering (Pandarinath, 2009) or lower burial diagenesis (Kisch, 1983).</text></s>

Diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry (DRS)
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac25" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>DRS is applied to estimate mineral composition along a core using the reflectance of light (Balsam et al., 1999; St-Onge et al., 2007).</text></s>
