Introduction
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Soils are the greatest terrestrial C stock and hold an estimated 1462-1548Pg of organic C to 1m depth (Batjes, 1996).</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, surface soils (0-30cm depth), which store almost half of soil organic carbon (SOC) and up to three times the C stored above-ground in vegetation, are considered to be the most vulnerable to loss as CO2 emissions due to climatic and land-management change, highlighting a major threat to climate regulation (Powlson et al., 2011a).</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>At the same time, it has been widely recognised that practices which maintain SOC stocks are important in ensuring the sustainability of soil functions (Lal, 2004; Nair et al., 2009a; Powlson et al., 2011a).</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Identifying how different agricultural management practices or changes in land-use create SOC sinks (accumulating additional C), act as C sources (emitting C) or maintain stocks at current levels is imperative in identifying effective strategies for land-based climate change mitigation.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Agriculture that is established on land depleted in SOC will have potential to sequester C.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, some practices such as addition of organic matter that may increase SOC can also increase N2O emissions.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In addition, it is not always clear how farm annual GHG flux may be altered by change in SOC stock, as this tends to occur slowly and with an uncertain trajectory.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Therefore, assessment of how best to achieve climate change mitigation through agriculture needs to consider both short-term changes in GHG emissions from soil and longer-term changes in SOC stocks (Lal, 2004; Smith et al., 2008).</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp1" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>To get a whole-system perspective this should be combined with assessment of changes in other C pools, such as above- and below-ground biomass and litter (e.g. of shade trees or crops such as coffee).</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Agroforestry systems (AFS) have been recognised for their potential to sequester large amounts of C above ground (and in some cases below ground into SOC) (Albrecht and Kandji, 2003; Nair et al., 2009a; Soto-Pinto et al., 2010; Verchot et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Nair et al. (2009a) have suggested an area of more than 1000million (M) ha globally to be currently managed under AFS, including silvopastoral systems, with 630Mha more estimated to be suitable for conversion of unproductive croplands and grasslands to AFS (IPCC, 2000).</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This suggests a great potential for further above- and below-ground C sequestration.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>It is commonly believed that AFS enhance SOC stocks compared with tree-less annual crop systems (Nair et al., 2009b).</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, much of this evidence is based on changes in the SOC of surface soils and little has been published on the effects of trees on stocks deeper in the soil.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac19" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Understanding of the soil processes involved is still limited, making it difficult to predict accurately changes in SOC over time (Nair et al., 2009b).</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac20" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Much evidence of increases in SOC stocks after changes in agricultural management is based on extrapolation from rates of C sequestration by growing plants using weak evidence about the processes by which this might influence SOC stocks (which can be positive or negative (Sanderman and Jeffrey, 2010)).</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac21" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>As a result of the complexity of assessing long-term SOC change, it had until recently been largely excluded from carbon accounting within land-based projects for international carbon markets, which tended to focus only on above-ground C as it is relatively easy to measure and model (IPCC, 2006).</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met1" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Recently, SOC has been included as a C pool within respected accounting methodologies, e.g.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>in four out of the seven used for small-scale afforestation and reforestation under the CDM pool (UNFCCC, 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>However, all except one use a default value of an increase in SOC of 0.5MgCha-1year-1 for a C accounting period of 20 years following afforestation or reforestation of land.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Similarly, the UNFCCC (2011) methodology specifies accounting by means of an assessment tool which is based on climatic default values that only allow for an increase in SOC, with a maximum value of 0.8MgCha-1year-1.</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Although initial losses of SOC through site preparation are recognised, the potential for reduction of SOC due to tree establishment is not accounted for.</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Use of these default values is rarely replaced by monitoring of actual changes in SOC stocks ex post, which might, in fact, reveal longer-term decreases in SOC (Bashkin and Binkley, 1998).</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Coffee production systems occupy over 10 million ha globally (FAO, 2011) so their design and management have potentially major importance for land-based C flux and storage.</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The aim of this study was to advance understanding of the extent to which producing coffee with shade trees (coffee agroforestry systems - CAFS) change SOC stocks and whether this provides a viable climate change mitigation strategy.</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met5" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Major variables in CAFS as implemented by farmers in Central America that we hypothesised would affect SOC stocks are: (i) the use of shade trees versus full-sun, (ii) amongst shade trees the use of timber species (unpruned, therefore predominantly providing only a litter input above-ground) versus nitrogen-fixing species that are frequently and heavily pruned; (iii) conventional chemical fertilisation versus organic fertilisation; (iv) the level at which these inputs are applied.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa3" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>By using experimental comparison of these specific variations amongst types of CAFS, this study sought to improve our understanding of the C cycle, the effects of coffee shade management on sequestration of C in soil relative to that in above-ground biomass, and the extent to which SOC should be taken into account in coffee-farm C projects considering the relative merits of alternative land-use C-accounting methods.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa4" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The specific objectives were to investigate (a) how the addition and management of trees in agricultural systems change total SOC stocks through the soil profile and (b) how agronomic management affects SOC stocks in comparison with the effects of the trees.</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj1" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>We evaluated these by assessing the differences in SOC firstly between shaded and un-shaded (full sun) coffee farming systems, and the effect that tree pruning has within shaded systems, and secondly between conventional and organic management, each with different input levels.</text></s>

<s sid="196"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac25" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>At the centre of this argument lies the issue exemplified by the question of how the fate of added organic C material would have differed were it to have an alternative use.</text></s>
<s sid="197"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac26" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For example, management practices that increase SOC through application of manure and other organic materials such as crop residues or prunings are often only a transfer of C from one terrestrial pool to another (Powlson et al., 2011b).</text></s>
<s sid="198"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp2" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>If alternative uses would have stored the C for longer (e.g. in solid wood products or through conversion of the organic material to biochar) or would have substituted for fossil fuel emissions (e.g. from domestic cooking) then they may have had a more positive effect on climate change mitigation.</text></s>
<s sid="199"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res94" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Assessments restricted to the soil itself show that changes in land management which increase SOC stocks could still have a detrimental net climate change impact by increasing emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHG) such as CH4 and N2O which have much higher global warming potentials (25 and 298 times respectively over 100 years) compared with CO2.</text></s>
<s sid="200"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res95" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For example, Noponen et al. (2012) estimated that the coffee management systems of the present experiments produced non-CO2 GHG emissions from soil ranging between 0.66 and 2.24MgCO2eha-1year-1 for the conventional and 0.55 and 2.02MgCO2eha-1year-1 for the organic treatments.</text></s>
<s sid="201"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con8" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Especially in the organic systems, which have additional organic matter inputs in the form of manures and coffee pulp, the climate change mitigation potential of the gains in SOC stock in the 0-10cm depth soil equate to an average of 1.45MgCO2eha-1year-1 in Costa Rica and 0.88MgCO2eha-1year-1 in Nicaragua, both of which lie well within the range of estimated non-CO2 GHG emissions from soil resulting from the inputs of organic matter.</text></s>
<s sid="202"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con9" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Therefore, the organic management may lead to no net mitigation of global warming via the soil and may even cause net GHG emissions.</text></s>
<s sid="203"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con10" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This calculation, however, does not include the GHG emissions associated with the transport of the organic material, or consider which of the emissions would also occur if the organic material is subject to alternative uses or fates, while analysis of conventional coffee management also needs to include the emissions associated with the production and transport of the agrochemicals that are used (Powlson et al., 2011b).</text></s>
<s sid="204"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res96" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Incorporation of some of the chicken manure and coffee pulp applied to coffee farms into the soil might result in lower GHG emissions than their decomposition in open air, should the soil have a capacity to absorb some of the CH4 and N2O emissions, which would be a priority for future research.</text></s>
<s sid="205"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res97" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Through their increase in the SOC content of upper soil layers, organic amendments can improve physical soil properties that are beneficial for crop production (Powlson et al., 2011a).</text></s>
<s sid="206"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con11" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This improvement in soil growing conditions might achieve equivalent yields to those obtained with higher applied nutrient contents in inorganic fertiliser, thereby reducing the net GHG emissions (especially of N2O) of the farming operation.</text></s>
<s sid="207"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con12" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Increased biomass growth rates of perennial crops and shade trees resulting from improved soil properties will further contribute to a real reduction of atmospheric CO2 concentration while the biomass remains intact.</text></s>
<s sid="208"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con13" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The existing condition of the soil is also an important consideration.</text></s>
<s sid="209"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con14" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The results of the present study show that where agroforestry systems are established on soils more depleted in SOC concentration they provide a greater potential for climate change mitigation through higher SOC stocks, at least until a new equilibrium in SOC concentration is reached (Johnston et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="210"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Therefore, despite the detailed measurement of these experiments, covering many aspects of C stocks and GHG emissions, it remains difficult to answer the question of the extent to which organic management is more favourable to mitigating global warming compared with conventional management, such is the complexity of processes involved.</text></s>
<s sid="211"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The diversity of net changes in SOC stocks amongst treatments found in the present study in Nicaragua and in Costa Rica illustrates the complexity of predicting which changes in existing coffee production systems will have a net positive or negative impact, especially where they involve soil-disturbing agronomic operations.</text></s>
<s sid="212"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The long timescale for changes in SOC stocks to become manifest also presents a challenge for the evidence.</text></s>
<s sid="213"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>There was an overall mean decrease of 0-40cm depth SOC stocks in eight of the ten shade treatments over the nine years after system establishment.</text></s>
<s sid="214"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con19" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, positive effects of shade tree growth might be realised over the longer term.</text></s>
<s sid="215"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac27" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>As already reported in many previous studies (Bashkin and Binkley, 1998; Binkley et al., 2004; Poulton et al., 2003; Resh et al., 2002; Richter et al., 1999) the benefits of shade trees in terms of sequestration of C into above-ground biomass are already apparent.</text></s>
<s sid="216"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res98" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For Costa Rica there was a range of mean sequestration rates per shade treatment of 3.3-12.9MgCha-1year-1 (Noponen et al., 2013), more than five times the rates of loss of 0-40cm depth SOC (with a range of 0.65-1.54MgCha-1year-1 per shade treatment) reported in the present paper.</text></s>
<s sid="217"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con20" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In Nicaragua, mean above-ground C sequestration rates ranged between 1.73 and 2.70MgCha-1year-1 per shade treatment (Noponen unpublished data) which are again higher than the loss or gain of 0-40cm depth SOC reported here (ranging from 0.44MgCha-1year-1 loss to 1.58MgCha-1year-1 gain).</text></s>
Conclusion
<s sid="218"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con21" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is commonly assumed that increasing above-ground C stocks by planting trees or perennial crops will result in an automatic proportional increase in SOC.</text></s>
<s sid="219"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The results of this nine-year study highlight, however, that this is not always the case and that, on the contrary, overall SOC might even decrease.</text></s>
<s sid="220"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Such a result should not be surprising given the multitude of factors influencing changes in SOC stock.</text></s>
<s sid="221"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Overall the results of this study show that the C stock changes down to 40cm soil depth were greatly outweighed by the C gains in the above-ground biomass.</text></s>
<s sid="222"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con25" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>While loss of SOC below 40cm depth probably also occurred, it is improbable that it matched the increases in above-ground biomass.</text></s>
<s sid="223"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res99" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This further emphasises the importance both of conservation of tree biomass in established forest and agroforestry systems and of avoiding practices that reduce stocks of SOC.</text></s>
<s sid="224"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con26" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Land use decisions designed to take into account impacts on climate change mitigation should be based on analyses that include all of the major components.</text></s>
<s sid="225"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con27" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>For example, assessment of alternative agricultural soil management systems that change SOC stocks should take into account not only C sequestration in the soil, but also emissions of all GHGs, impacts on biomass growth rate of all system components and impacts on crop yield (with its potential effect on future farmer management decisions).</text></s>
