Introduction

<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>DNA methylation is established and maintained by a family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), including DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, and deficiency in any Dnmt enzyme leads to embryonic death in mice.</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Additionally, aberrant DNA methylation is associated with human diseases such as cancer, immunodeficiency, and neurological disorders (Feng and Fan, 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Collectively, these observations indicate that DNA methylation plays critical roles in mammalian development.</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>DNA methylation is also important for both stem cell differentiation and cellular reprogramming.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In differentiation, dynamic DNA methylation changes are critical for lineage specification as a wave of de novo methylation takes place to silence pluripotency genes and establish tissue-specific methylation patterns (Hawkins et al., 2010; Lister et al., 2009; Stadler et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>During reprogramming, DNA methylation contributes to an epigenetic barrier.</text></s>

<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Meanwhile, a wave of de novo methylation also occurs during reprogramming whereby tissue-specific genes and partially methylated domains (PMDs) become hypermethylated (Doi et al., 2009; Lister et al., 2009, 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have the characteristics of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and many studies have investigated the similarities between iPSCs and hESCs, including genome stabilities, transcriptome (Chin et al., 2009; Guenther et al., 2010; Newman and Cooper, 2010; Wang et al., 2011) and histone modifications (Guenther et al., 2010), and DNA methylation (Bock et al., 2011; Doi et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2010; Lister et al., 2011; Ohi et al., 2011; Ruiz et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac19" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These studies revealed both similarities and differences in the properties of iPSCs and hESCs.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac20" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>DNA methylation in iPSCs has been reported to acquire irregular methylation patterns while retaining some memory of somatic cells during the reprogramming process, thus exhibiting a methylation profile unique to iPSCs (Bock et al., 2011; Doi et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2010; Lister et al., 2011; Ohi et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac21" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, because these previous studies differed in the quantitation techniques, genome coverage, and sample sizes employed, it remains contentious whether iPSCs possess a methylation signature that can be used to distinguish iPSCs from hESCs.</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>To address this issue, we systemically compared the methylation profiles of a large number of human iPSCs (hiPSCs) and hESCs from multiple labs to revisit the question of whether hiPSCs have a unique CpG methylation signature.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>We identified a panel of 82 CpGs that can distinguish hiPSCs from hESCs with high accuracy.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Remarkably, 12 signature CpG sites tended to be hypermethylated compared with both somatic cells and hESCs, suggesting that these methylation signatures are not a form of residual somatic epigenetic memory.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con3" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Hypermethylation of these 12 sites is partially disrupted in DNMT3B-deficient hiPSCs, consistent with the function of DNMT3B for de novo methylation during reprogramming.</text></s>

<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In previous reports, investigators have debated whether hiPSCs exhibit a unique CpG methylation profile due to either residual somatic cell memory or aberrant methylation in select domains when compared with hESCs.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj4" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In this study, we investigated this topic by analyzing CpG methylation in a large number of pluripotent cell samples (n = 269) from multiple labs, thus increasing the power of the statistical analyses.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj5" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Using Illumina Infinium BeadChip assays, we first examined the methylation profiles of 25 cell lines, including five hESCs, five parental somatic cells, and 15 lines of hiPSCs covering hiPSCs generated by both vector-containing and vector-free methods.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Globally, hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated that hiPSCs are highly similar to hESCs, but distinctively different from somatic cells (Figure 1A).</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>To identify differential methylation between hiPSCs and hESCs, we used a statistically stringent cutoff from Illumina's custom model (see Experimental Procedures) and required an absolute methylation difference (delta-beta) of 0.3.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>We found that the methylation profiles from 82 CpG sites in 66 genes can effectively group hiPSCs separately from either hESCs or parental somatic cells (Figure 1B; Table S1 available online).</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res4" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the signature genes were associated with epidermal cell differentiation and keratinization (Figure 1C).</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Interestingly, comparisons of the hiPSC methylation signature among hESCs, hiPSCs, and somatic cells revealed that the hiPSCs' methylation pattern often resembled that of somatic cells, except at 12 CpG sites that appeared to be uniquely hypermethylated compared with both hESCs and somatic cells (Figure 1B).</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This result suggested that the hiPSC methylation signature consists of both residual somatic memory and specific CpG sites that are subject to de novo methylation.</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Ultimately, a robust signature should be able to accurately discriminate between hiPSCs and hESCs in independent data sets regardless of the laboratory of origin or the quantitation method used.</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met1" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Although hierarchal clustering is one way to visualize how multiple samples are grouped, we turned to more robust and quantitative classification methods.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>To provide an unbiased estimate of predictive accuracy for cell type, we used a leave-one-out analysis in which the support vector machine (SVM) learning model was fit on all but one sample and its prediction was related to the truly observed cell type of the left-out sample (see Experimental Procedures).</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Using other DNA methylation data available in the public domain, we consistently found that our signature CpGs could significantly improve accuracy over randomly selected CGs for identifying hiPSCs and hESCs.</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Although randomly selected CGs tended to have a relatively high accuracy, this appeared to be related to the level of hESC or hiPSC skew in the data set (data not shown).</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Nevertheless, in general, we observed correct classification of &gt;95% of the samples with a false discovery rate (FDR) of &lt;0.05.</text></s>

<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We found that our panel of CG signature sites was able to accurately discriminate between hiPSCs and hESCs despite the varying sample sizes among different studies.</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj6" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>For example, we analyzed an independently derived Infinium 27k BeadChip data set that profiled DNA methylation in 20 hiPSCs and 11 hESCs (Chou et al., 2011), and showed a classification accuracy of 96%.</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj7" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Another study using the same platform examined 42 and 115 normal hiPSCs and hESCs (Nazor et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con6" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In this larger data set, we could still accurately distinguish ∼97% of the hiPSCs and hESCs.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con7" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Together, these results indicated that the methylation signature is robust to sample size sampling error.</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con8" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Remarkably, our DNA methylation signature was also able to accurately discriminate between hiPSCs and hESCs regardless of the quantitation platform or technique used.</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj8" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In a data set compiled using the Infinium 450k BeadChip system, we examined DNA methylation in 29 hiPSCs and 18 hESCs (Nazor et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Interestingly, although only 70 of the 82 signature probes were shared between the two Illumina BeadChip platforms, these 70 probes were still able to discriminate hiPSCs from hESCs with 97% accuracy.</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa3" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Next, we tried to cross-reference our signature CpGs with publically available genome-wide bisulfite sequencing data sets.</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Although the reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) method is a cost-effective way to sample ∼3 million CpGs in the human genome (Bock et al., 2011; Ziller et al., 2011), we found that RRBS coverage had low overlap with the 82 signature CG sites (∼35 loci [∼40%] were detected) and was not ideal for cross-referencing.</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>We therefore turned to whole-genome shotgun bisulfite sequencing data sets and curated a total of five hiPSCs and three hESCs generated from three separate labs (Chodavarapu et al., 2010; Laurent et al., 2010; Lister et al., 2009, 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Strikingly, methylation quantitation of the 82 signature sites through bisulfite sequencing could also separate hiPSCs from hESCs with 95% accuracy.</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Altogether, we analyzed 114 hiPSCs and 155 hESCs collected from multiple labs, and these results indicated that the identified CpG signature in our study is robust and can be broadly used to make a distinction between hiPSCs and hESCs.</text></s>

<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Because different somatic cells could have different tissue- and cell-specific methylation patterns, we were interested in dissecting the precise methylation changes during the derivation of each iPSC line.</text></s>
<s sid="63"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We therefore performed a pairwise comparison in each CpG site between three pairs of hiPSCs and their parental somatic cells generated in our lab.</text></s>
<s sid="64"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We first identified genes that exhibited statistically significant changes in methylation pattern using a delta-beta value of ≥0.3 or a cutoff of ≤-0.3.</text></s>
<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Our data indicated that ∼7%-14% of gene promoters underwent methylation changes during direct reprogramming (Figure 2A), and 3.5- to 6-fold more gene promoters exhibited an increase in methylation than showed a decrease in methylation.</text></s>
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This result is in line with previous observations describing a large number of hypermethylated promoters during reprogramming (Nishino et al., 2011), including hypermethylation at MEG3, PEG3, ZIM2, and other imprinted loci (Nazor et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Indeed, high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) showed an overall increased level of DNA methylation in hiPSCs compared with parental somatic cells (Figure 2B).</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res21" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Notably, of the gene promoters with significant methylation changes during reprogramming (∼1,000), 11 (or 1%) were also associated with the hiPSC signature.</text></s>
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res22" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Thus, a small portion of the hiPSC signature arises from global methylation changes during the reprogramming process, whereas the remaining portion of signature CpG sites are associated with somatic epigenetic memory.</text></s>
<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res23" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>By cross-referencing gene-expression profiles between hiPSCs and parental somatic cells, we found that ∼60%-75% of de novo methylation genes showed a significant reduction of gene expression (FDR &lt; 10-10) or not expressed in hiPSCs (Figure 2C; Table S2).</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res24" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The increased methylation levels at promoter CpG sites in hiPSCs were confirmed by conventional bisulfite sequencing analysis (Figure S1).</text></s>

<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res27" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These silenced genes were also depleted from genes involved in housekeeping functions such as intracellular membrane organelle, cellular metabolic process, and regulation of transcription (Figure 2D).</text></s>
<s sid="75"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res28" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In addition to global hypermethylation, some of the methylation signature sites (n = 12) were also uniquely hypermethylated in hiPSCs, but hypomethylated in both somatic cells and a portion of hESCs (Figure 1B).</text></s>
<s sid="76"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res29" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Remarkably, these 12 sites were consistently hypermethylated in hiPSCs compared with hESCs in independent data sets (Figure 3A), confirming that these sites tended to show unidirectional differential methylation.</text></s>
<s sid="77"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res30" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, on several occasions, we found heterogeneity in the methylation level at these 12 loci in hESCs (Figure S2).</text></s>

<s sid="81"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con9" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thus, prolonged culture appears to attenuate the hypermethylation at these 12 sites in a portion of hESCs.</text></s>
<s sid="82"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con10" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, we have not analyzed methylation data of hiPSCs in extended culture (Table S3), so we cannot preclude the possibility that these 12 sites would show a similar epigenetic drift in long-term culture.</text></s>

<s sid="105"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>By comparing methylation patterns in mutant ICF-iPSCs, we indeed found some altered methylation signatures, suggesting that DNMT3B contributes to de novo methylation during reprogramming.</text></s>
<s sid="106"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con19" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In particular, we identified five signature CpGs (out of the 82 CpG signature sites) that undergo DNMT3B-mediated de novo methylation.</text></s>
<s sid="107"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac24" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This conclusion was also extended to hypermethylation signatures identified by others (Lister et al., 2011; Ruiz et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="108"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac25" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Our methylation signature is different from what was previously identified by either microarray or high-throughput sequencing analysis.</text></s>
<s sid="109"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac26" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Earlier studies suffered primarily from limited sample sizes due to the costly approach required to measure genome-wide DNA methylation levels on a comprehensive scale.</text></s>
<s sid="110"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac27" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Several previous studies using RRBS attempted to verify reported signatures in the literature and found a lack of reproducibility (Bock et al., 2011; Ziller et al., 2011), arguing instead for variations in iPSCs.</text></s>
<s sid="111"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con20" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Because RRBS covers ∼10% of human CpG sites and is biased toward regions of high CpG density, it is possible that the method could not fully detect the regions that were consistently different in iPSCs.</text></s>
<s sid="112"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con21" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>A more recent study by Ruiz et al. (2012) using the bisulfite sequencing padlock probe (BSPP) system identified nine signature genes that distinguish hESCs from hiPSCs.</text></s>
<s sid="113"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>On average, BSPP covers 500,000 CpGs in the human genome (∼1% of all human CpG sites); however, these sites have low overlap with the Infinium 27k array (∼25% shared sites within 100 bp).</text></s>
<s sid="114"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Moreover, when we compared our list of signature CG sites with other signatures in the literature, we found minimal overlap (Doi et al., 2009; Lister et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="115"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether this low overlap is due to incompatible coverage or lack of sample size for robust delineation of an accurate signature.</text></s>
<s sid="116"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con25" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>For example, Lister et al. (2011) initially identified hundreds of CG-DMRs in iPSCs, only a small fraction of which could be confirmed in multiple cell lines, suggesting that the number of sites is gradually reduced as the sample size becomes larger.</text></s>
<s sid="117"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con26" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>By contrast, although we identified a methylation signature using 25 cell lines, we were able to validate these signatures in 249 other samples, demonstrating that our signature comprises a core set of CpG sites that can reliably distinguish iPSCs, hESCs, and somatic cells.</text></s>
<s sid="118"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con27" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Overall, we suggest that although a definitive signature whereby a given site is always differentially methylated between the two cell types may not exist, a panel of CpG sites representing loci that tend to be differentially methylated is sufficient to segregate iPSCs and hESCs.</text></s>
<s sid="119"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con28" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thus, this panel of CpG methylation signatures in iPSCs may be useful as a molecular biomarker for classifying iPSCs in the future.</text></s>
