Introduction
<s sid="10"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Organic solar cells are a very promising, low cost and scalable alternative to conventional silicon-based solar cells [1-3].</text></s>
<s sid="11"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Some of the highest efficiency organic devices are thin-film polymer-fullerene bulk heterojunction junction (BHJ) solar cells [4,5].</text></s>
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In BHJ devices, the p-type polymer and n-type fullerene are intimately mixed to form a nanoscale interpenetrating network, which improves charge separation by providing a large interfacial area, resulting in a significantly increased photocurrent [2,6].</text></s>
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>BHJ devices in the so-called 'inverted' structure improve the ease of fabrication because a stable, high work function anode can be used as the top contact to collect holes from the polymer [3].</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>A transparent conducting cathode is used to collect electrons from the fullerene on the other side of the blend [7].</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met5" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>However, in a BHJ device, the p-type and n-type materials would both be in contact with the cathode and anode, which results in recombination at the electrodes [8].</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met6" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>At the anode, this has been overcome by inserting an electron-blocking layer, such as MoO3 [8,9], V2O5 [8,10], WOx [8] or the polymer PEDOT:PSS [8-10].</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met7" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>At the cathode, TiO2 [9] and ZnO [1-3,7-10] have been used as hole blocking layers due to their low hole conductivity and high electron mobility [11].</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met8" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>These oxides have been deposited using vacuum-based processes, such as conventional atomic layer deposition (ALD) [12,13], and also ambient processes, such as sol-gel [1,2] and electrodeposition [14].</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met9" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>While ambient methods are attractive for the commercialisation of low-cost photovoltaics [1,2], most are batch processes, which limits their throughput.</text></s>

<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod2" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The system we have used involves a gas manifold and the process is schematically shown in Fig. 1 [19,20].</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met10" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The substrate moves through the metal precursor (M) and oxidant (O) gas streams beneath the AALD manifold, resulting in the oxide growing one monolayer at a time.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met11" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The manifold is also in close proximity to the substrate (&lt;100µm) to ensure laminar flow of the gas streams so that the inert gas channels (I) act as 'shields' to prevent oxygen ingress from the atmosphere and also to prevent the precursors from mixing together [19].</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met12" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The design of the manifold allows the two purge steps between oxidant/metal precursor exposures in conventional ALD to be eliminated, which enables more rapid depositions [16].</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj2" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In this work, we studied AALD ZnO as the hole blocking layer in the following device architecture: glass/ITO/AALD ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>P3HT:PCBM was selected because it is well-studied and therefore suitable for investigating the AALD ZnO.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj4" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>MoO3 was also selected as the electron-blocking layer because we have used it successfully in the past, which allowed us to focus on studying the AALD ZnO, although a process more suitable for roll-to-roll processing, such as slot-die coating of vanadyl-triisopropoxide [10], would ultimately need to be used for large scale, high-throughput fabrication.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met13" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In addition to charge selection, the AALD ZnO hole-blocking layer plays an important role in extending device lifetime through UV-filtering [15,21].</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res4" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The key property requirements of hole-blocking layers are: (i) compactness [1,2], (ii) high stability [1,2], (iii) high electron mobility [1], (iv) transparency to visible light [1,2,22], and (v) good blend wettability [22].</text></s>

<s sid="88"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This device was obtained using 125nm thick AALD ZnO (deposited in only 4.5 min) and tested one week after manufacture.</text></s>
<s sid="89"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This cell had a power conversion efficiency (PCE or η) of 3.6%, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.602V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of -10.2mA/cm2 and fill factor (FF) of 59%.</text></s>

<s sid="94"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The thinness of an effective AALD ZnO layer and the short time of deposition are significant for industrial scalability, because it means that an effective hole-blocking layer could be obtained rapidly with very little material.</text></s>

<s sid="96"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This is because the AALD oxide can be grown around an order of magnitude faster than standard ALD and does not require a vacuum [19], and also the method is amenable to roll-to-roll processing while sol-gel and electrodeposition are not.</text></s>

<s sid="109"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res28" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The efficiency increased with the post-annealing temperature of the 125nm thick AALD ZnO film due to an increase in the fill factor and open-circuit voltage, as can be seen in Table 1 and the J-V curves in Fig. 5.</text></s>
<s sid="110"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res29" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In order to meet the requirement for flexible device manufacturing, the post-annealing temperature should not exceed the upper working temperature of the plastic substrate.</text></s>

<s sid="112"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Post-annealing at 150°C is therefore most suitable for plastic substrate solar cells because this improves the device performance compared with no annealing (from 1.7+0.2% to 2.4+0.5%), and yet the processing does not damage the plastic substrates.</text></s>
<s sid="113"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con6" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Also, since the AALD ZnO films were deposited at 150°C, it is not expected that post-annealing at temperatures lower than 150°C would significantly improve the device performance, especially considering the cost of the increased processing time and increased energy requirement.</text></s>
<s sid="114"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con7" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thus, the AALD not only has significant commercial potential because it can deposit compact oxide films rapidly in open atmosphere, but it is also highly compatible with the high throughput roll-to-roll deposition of the oxide on large area plastic substrates.</text></s>
Stability
<s sid="115"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res30" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Device stability is an extremely important factor for commercialisation [7].</text></s>
<s sid="116"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res31" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The devices with annealed AALD ZnO and the MoO3 electron blocking layers were kept at open-circuit in the dark under ambient conditions and re-measured after 200 days in a test similar to an ISOS-D-1 Shelf test [24].</text></s>
<s sid="117"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res32" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It can be seen in Fig. 4 that there was no statistically significant change in the device performance after this period.</text></s>
<s sid="118"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res33" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The result shows that the AALD ZnO is chemically and structurally stable because if it were not, the blend would have come into contact with the ITO, leading to recombination and a deterioration in device performance [8].</text></s>
<s sid="119"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res34" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Hole blocking layer electron mobility</text></s>
<s sid="120"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res35" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The electron mobility of spin-coated ZnO nanoparticles used for hole-blocking layers has been reported to be 0.066cm2/Vs [1,30].</text></s>
<s sid="121"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res36" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The as-grown AALD ZnO films of this work had two orders of magnitude higher electron mobility of 3.4+0.1cm2/Vs, which is consistent with the high compactness of the films.</text></s>
<s sid="122"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res37" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This would have allowed the electrons that reached the AALD ZnO layer to be rapidly transported to the cathode.</text></s>
<s sid="123"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res38" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, the blend layer dominated the series resistance due to the much lower mobilities of the organic materials (10-5-10-3cm2/Vs) [31,32].</text></s>
<s sid="124"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res39" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This can be seen from the series resistances of the devices which do not significantly change for different thicknesses or storage time (Fig. 4d).</text></s>
Transmittance
<s sid="125"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res40" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The ZnO hole-blocking layer should also allow visible light to pass through to the blend, but filter out the UV light to prevent blend degradation and thus improve device longevity [15,22].</text></s>
<s sid="126"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res41" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Transmittance measurements of annealed 15nm and 125nm thick AALD ZnO films on glass are shown in Fig. 6.</text></s>
<s sid="127"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met14" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Background measurements on glass only were performed to account for reflection and absorption by the glass.</text></s>
<s sid="128"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res42" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The onset of absorption occurred at a wavelength of 360nm (band gap of 3.4eV, as expected for ZnO), and the films had high transmittance for visible wavelengths.</text></s>
<s sid="129"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res43" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For wavelengths between 390nm and 700nm, the annealed 15nm film had an average transmittance of 96%, and the annealed 125nm film 92%.</text></s>
<s sid="130"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res44" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Both the 15nm and 125nm films had transmittances up to 100%.</text></s>
<s sid="131"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res45" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Below the onset of absorption, the transmittance of the 125nm film (8% on average) was much lower than that of the 15nm film (65% on average) due to there being more absorbing material, as expected.</text></s>
<s sid="132"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con8" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These results compare well with the literature, where transmittances are typically 55-100% for visible wavelengths and 20-60% for wavelengths below the onset of absorption [14,22,33], indicating that the smooth, compact ZnO layer admits visible light well to the blend and that the thicker ZnO films are especially effective at limiting UV light transmission.</text></s>
<s sid="133"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res46" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The high transmittance of visible light by the AALD ZnO films is also consistent with the JSC of the best device being comparable with the highest values from literature.</text></s>
Film wettability
<s sid="134"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res47" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Good wettability is desirable for the AALD ZnO so that the contact area with the blend and the fraction of photogenerated charge in the PCBM that is collected are both maximised [22].</text></s>
<s sid="135"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res48" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Good wettability, in addition to compactness, should lead to high fill factors and VOCs because of good contact between the blend and the hole-blocking layer [34].</text></s>
<s sid="136"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res49" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>From Fig. 3a, it can be seen that the blend has very good contact with the AALD ZnO layer to the extent that there was no delamination even after fracturing for cross-sectional SEM.</text></s>
<s sid="137"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res50" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This led to high VOCs of ~0.6V (Fig. 4a) that were comparable with the highest values in the literature for inverted BHJ P3HT:PCBM devices [3,7,8,12,13].</text></s>
<s sid="138"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res51" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The fill factors were also high and averaged around ~50% (Fig. 4c).</text></s>
<s sid="139"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res52" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The fill factor of the best device was also comparable with the highest values in the literature for inverted BHJ P3HT:PCBM devices [3,7,8,12,13].</text></s>
Conclusions
<s sid="140"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con9" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We have shown that inverted BHJ devices made with rapidly grown ZnO hole blocking layers using atmospheric atomic layer deposition (AALD) give device performances that are comparable with the best inverted P3HT:PCBM BHJ devices reported to date.</text></s>
<s sid="141"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con10" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Working devices with good, but lower performance were obtained without any post-annealing of the as-grown AALD ZnO.</text></s>
<s sid="142"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con11" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>On the other hand, these unannealed AALD ZnO films are suitable for making flexible, plastic substrate solar cells.</text></s>
<s sid="143"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con12" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>A compromise between device performance and suitability for making plastic substrate solar cells was achieved by post-annealing the ZnO films at 150°C.</text></s>
<s sid="144"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con13" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The AALD ZnO fulfils the properties required for good hole blocking layers: the films are compact, have a high electron mobility, have up to 100% visible light transmittance, good blend wettability and very good device stability over time.</text></s>
<s sid="145"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con14" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In addition, the deposition process occurs under atmospheric conditions and has the potential to be implemented in a roll-to-roll process.</text></s>
<s sid="146"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>AALD ZnO films are therefore highly suited as multifunctional components for inverted BHJ devices.</text></s>
