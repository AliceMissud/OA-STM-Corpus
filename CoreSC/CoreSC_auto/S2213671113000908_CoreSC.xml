Introduction
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The development of a universal protocol to differentiate any hPSC line into a homogenous population of a specific cell type has been rendered difficult by the inherent variability that exists between lines.</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Epigenetic memory, inconsistent reprogramming, and genetic background are likely to be the main cause of this variability, which represents a major challenge for the development of personalized medicines (Lund et al., 2012) and for modeling diseases with a low-penetrance phenotype.</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The expansion of intermediate stages of differentiation could represent an attractive alternative to address this issue, especially if these cell types can be isolated from a heterogeneous population.</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For example, neuronal stem cells can be easily expanded from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC) lines differentiated toward the neuroectoderm lineage and then differentiated into a diversity of neurons, thereby bypassing the need to continuously grow pluripotent cells (Falk et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, the same approach with endoderm differentiation has been more problematic because the complex combination of inductive signals controlling the specification and patterning of this germ layer can be difficult to mimic in vitro (Sneddon et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Following gastrulation, definitive endoderm migrates to form the primitive gut, which initially consists of a single flattened sheet of cells surrounded by mesoderm.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Simultaneously, as migration is occurring, the primitive gut is becoming regionalized along the dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior axes into foregut, midgut, and hindgut domains (Wells and Melton, 1999).</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This patterning is induced by the surrounding mesoderm, which secretes a variety of growth factors not limited to activin, Wnt, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signal pathways (Deutsch et al., 2001; Zaret, 2002).</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res1" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The effects of these signaling pathways can be observed at the molecular level with distinct expression patterns of genes such as SOX2 in the foregut and CDX2 in the hindgut, while early PDX1 expression marks the midgut (Zorn and Wells, 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res2" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It is from the foregut region that many of the major organ systems develop such as the liver, thyroid, lungs, the upper airways, the billary system, stomach, and pancreas.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The induction of these organs is orchestrated by a complex combination of morphogen gradients secreted by other developing organ systems such as the cardiac mesoderm (Lemaigre and Zaret, 2004).</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The exact nature of these concentration gradients remains difficult to reproduce faithfully in vitro, but several groups (including our own) have made significant progress in understanding how different signaling pathways impact the foregut endoderm cells (Cho et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>To date, no one has described a foregut cell type that possesses the proliferative and differentiation potential observed within the early mammalian gut tube.</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa3" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>To address this challenge, we have developed a defined culture system to derive human foregut stem cells (hFSCs) from hPSCs.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa4" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>These stem cells can self-renew in vitro and resemble multipotent cells of the anterior primitive gut tube by their capacity to differentiate into pancreatic and hepatic cells.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa5" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Furthermore, hFSCs can be easily derived from hIPSC lines resistant to endoderm differentiation, thereby enabling the production of endodermal derivatives from a broad number of hPSC lines.</text></s>

<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Flow cytometry analyses showed that 80% of the resulting DE population coexpresses CXCR4 and SOX17 (Figure S1D).</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Interestingly, the resulting population of DE cells is negative for genes marking the foregut (SOX2), the midgut/hindgut (CDX2), the pancreas (PDX1), the liver (AFP), and the lungs (HOXA1) (Figures S1E and S1F) This confirms that DE cells generated in vitro could correspond to early endoderm progenitor cells prior to anteroposterior patterning or organogenesis.</text></s>

<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>On the other hand, DE cells grown in the presence of the GSK3β inhibitor CHIR99021 express midgut/hindgut markers such as CDX2 and HOXC5 (Figures 1C and 1D) and show no expression of anterior markers.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>During both activin-A treatment and CHIR treatment, cells express high levels of the primitive gut markers GATA4, HNF4a, EpCAM, and HOXA2, demonstrating that cells retain their endodermal identity under these conditions (data not shown).</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Of note, flow cytometry analyses revealed that 90% of the cells express SOX2 after activin-A treatment while 85% of the cells were positive for CDX2 after CHIR99021 treatment (Figures 1E and 1F).</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Similar results were obtained using two hIPSC lines (BBHX8 and A1ATD.1) (Figures S2A-S2H).</text></s>
