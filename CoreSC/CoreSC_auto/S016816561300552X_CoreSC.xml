Introduction
<s sid="9"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) are generated from reprogrammed fibroblasts by overexpression of pluripotency factors (Takahashi et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="10"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These pluripotent cells have the unique characteristic to self renew in vitro while maintaining the capacity to differentiate into a broad number of cell types.</text></s>
<s sid="11"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>By combining these unique properties, hiPSC could enable the generation of large quantity of cells for clinical applications.</text></s>
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot2" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Furthermore, the possibility of generating hiPSC from somatic cells using epigenetic reprogramming represents a unique opportunity for personalized regenerative medicine.</text></s>
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj1" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Indeed, these pluripotent stem cells could enable the production of patient specific cell types that are fully immuno-compatible with the original donor thereby avoiding the need for immune suppressive treatment after cell transplantation.</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj2" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Nevertheless, the practical, financial and temporal obstacles in producing and validating personalized clinical-grade hiPSC and their differentiated progeny will almost certainly limit the feasibility of this approach.</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These limitations could selectively restrict patient access to autologous cell-based therapies (Faden et al., 2003).</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The creation of clinical banks of hiPSC from donors that can provide HLA matching to recipients is proposed as a strategy to attenuate the host immune response to transplanted tissue (Lin et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2005, 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Similarly, hiPSC can be used to develop in vitro disease models, allowing large scale studies otherwise restricted due to the limited availability of primary cells and biopsy material.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This application has been proven useful to model neurodegenerative diseases, cardiac syndromes and metabolic disorders in vitro for basic studies and drug screening (Ebert et al., 2009; Moretti et al., 2010; Rashid et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, each of these applications requires large quantity of hiPSC produced in reproducible and standardized ways.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Indeed, expansion of hiPSC remains time and resources consuming while experimental variability due to human intervention is almost systematic.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Process automation has been a key mechanism to achieve controlled and standardized cell production.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Successful automated protocols have been developed for the expansion of human mesenchymal stem cells (Thomas et al., 2007) and human embryonic stem cells (hESC) (Thomas et al., 2009b).</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot3" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Scale up automation enables scale out for conventional formats with predictable process variation and quality outcome by removing manual interventions.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot4" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>However, little work has been done in developing technologies for automation and scale up of hiPSC for healthcare applications.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Several solutions and technologies have been developed for live cell production in suspension platforms (Ratcliffe et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot5" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>However these are not readily adapted for cells growing in adherent conditions.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot6" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Furthermore, large scale production of hiPSC for clinical applications would require expansion in culture using clinically compatible conditions in a reproducible way without loss of function and in sufficient numbers to create reproducible and cost effective therapeutic products.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Finally, passaging represent the main difficulty to develop an automation platform to expand hiPSC since these cells must be propagated as aggregates/clumps to maintain their integrity and quality (Beers et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Indeed, evidence indicates that hiPSC grown and harvested as single cells are more likely to acquire genetic anomalies (Amps et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Consequently, standardization of cell counting and cell clump size measurement has proven to be impractical.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Here, we have addressed all these issues by transferring an established manual method to grow hiPSC in feeder free and chemically defined medium onto an automated platform compatible with large scale production.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This study shows for the first time that large scale automated production of hiPSC is possible without the need of single cell dissociation thereby respecting their natural properties.</text></s>

Manufacturing platform and instrumentation
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The CompacT SelecT (The Automation Partnership, UK) is a fully automated cell culture platform which incorporates a small six-axis anthropomorphic robotic arm (Cell Therapy Manufacturing Facility, 2011) that can access 90 T175 flask and plate incubators, controlled at 37°C under an atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2 and humidity.</text></s>

<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met5" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>At Loughborough University, the CompacT SelecT has been successfully used to culture many different cell types including human mesenchymal cells and human embryonic stem cells (hESC) (Thomas et al., 2007, 2009a,b).</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The CompacT SelecT has also been shown to be successful at preventing contamination when the GMP version of the CompacT SelecT passed the &quot;sterile fill&quot; runs (Chandra et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The CompacT SelecT allows activities during cell culture such as seeding, media changes and measurement cells in a controlled environment (Thomas, 2012).</text></s>

<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For many manual cell culture protocols, there is a centrifugation step to concentrate the cell suspension and allow for cells to be washed.</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, in this instance, cells grow in aggregates and do not require centrifugation as they settle under gravity.</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp9" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>In order to transfer the culture protocol to the CompacT SelecT it was necessary to scale up from a T25 to a T175 flask, media volumes were scaled proportionally to flask surface area, and work within the restricted set of plasticware and the allowable positioning of the plasticware within the automated system (Fig. 1).</text></s>

Conclusion
<s sid="112"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con14" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated a protocol passaging hiPSC in an automated system, the CompacT SelecT, with cells maintained as aggregates.</text></s>
<s sid="113"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This work has shown that hiPSC can be passaged in an automated system without losing their pluripotent capabilities.</text></s>
<s sid="114"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Cells maintained their characteristic hiPSC morphology and expressed pluripotency markers both by immunochemistry and qPCR.</text></s>
<s sid="115"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Additionally, these cells maintained the capacity to differentiate into the three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm and neuroectoderm).</text></s>
<s sid="116"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The comparison between manual and automated conditions showed the maintenance and passaging of hiPSC is feasible using the CompacT SelecT system, however to improve reproducibility some detailed changes will have to be implemented.</text></s>
<s sid="117"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con19" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Further work is necessary to define more accurately the critical protocol parameters and take account of the constraints required when generating fully functional hiPSC lines for clinical applications.</text></s>
<s sid="118"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con20" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>With respect to future automated solutions incubator design must take into account the current necessity of not disturbing cells that require to be grown as aggregates, such as hiPSC and that take time (potentially up to 24h) to attach.</text></s>
<s sid="119"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con21" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Automation would most certainly benefit from development of (conical) plastic vessels of the volume necessary to accommodate cell suspensions from T175 flasks as this could reduce the time for cell clumps to settle and thus speeding the passaging protocol.</text></s>
<s sid="120"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The option to use a pipette with smaller bore than a 10ml pipette would assist the optimization of breaking cell clumps to the desirable size and reduce the single cell debris caused by pipetting.</text></s>
<s sid="121"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>While these modifications would be required to optimize the present protocol to ensure maximum yields of cells, this study represents a proof of principle that hiPSC can be expanded in clumps using automation without loss of quality.</text></s>
