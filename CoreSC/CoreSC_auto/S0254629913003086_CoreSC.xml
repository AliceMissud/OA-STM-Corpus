Introduction
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Phosphorus is the second most important mineral nutrient for plant growth after N.</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Although total phosphate is abundant in many soils, it is largely unavailable for root uptake (Lambers et al., 2008), because, about 20-80% of soil P occurs in organic forms (Richardson et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Soil P easily forms insoluble complexes with cations, and/or incorporated into organic matter by microbes (Tran et al., 2010; Vance et al., 2003).</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Even where P is applied as fertilizer, more than 80% becomes unavailable for plant uptake through adsorption, precipitation, or microbial immobilization (Holford, 1997; Mόzner et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Thus crop yield on the 30-40% of the world's arable land is limited by P availability (Kochian et al., 2004; Lambers et al., 2006; Vance et al., 2003).</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In low P soils, both plants and microbes have developed various strategies for enhancing P supply.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These include acidification of the rhizosphere, exudation of organic acids (Dakora and Phillips, 2002), and secretion of extracellular phosphatases (Kanu and Dakora, 2009, 2012; Kanu et al., 2007; Makoi et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Acid phosphatases are enzymes of plant origin (Tarafdar et al., 2001), while alkaline phosphatases are secreted by bacteria, fungi and earthworms (Hebrien and Neal, 1990) and function catalytically above pΗ 7.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These enzymes catalyze the cleavage of mineral P from organic phosphate esters, in acidic and alkaline soils that are low in P (Nannipieri et al., 2011), thus making P more available in these soils.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Organic P from soil organic matter is therefore the main substrate for P supply by phosphatases in natural and agricultural ecosystems.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Soils of the Cape fynbos are characterized by low organic matter, low pΗ (pH3-5), and low nutrient levels (Dakora, 2012), especially plant-available N (0.001-0.002% N, or 1 to 2mgNg-1soil) and P (0.00004 to 0.00037% P, or 0.4-3.7μgPg-1; Cramer, 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Furthermore, soils of the fynbos biome contain between 58-77% organic P and 2-88% inorganic P, which is Fe-bound and unavailable to plants (Straker, 1996).</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Despite these nutrient constraints, the fynbos is rich in many indigenous legume genera and species.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For example, the genus Aspalathus consists of 281 species that are endemic to the Cape Floristic Region (Boatwright and Cupido, 2011), while Cyclopia has 24 species that uniquely occur only in the Cape fynbos (Du Toit et al., 1998).</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>N limitation in legumes of the fynbos is overcome by high levels of N2 fixation.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For example, Aspalathus linearis and Cyclopia species can contribute over 100kgNha-1 annually to the fynbos biome (Moufhe and Dakora, 1999; Spriggs and Dakora, 2008).</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, little is known about P nutrition in fynbos legumes.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Different mechanisms have been proposed for enhanced P supply and mineral uptake by fynbos species.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac19" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Mycorrhizal infection of fynbos legumes has been suggested to enhance P supply by the symbiosis (Harrison, 1999), just as formation of cluster roots has been regarded as a way of increasing P nutrition in fynbos legumes (Kanu et al., 2013; Lambers and Shane, 2007; Lamont, 1982).</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con3" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We have, in fact, shown that cluster root formation by A. linearis in the Cape fynbos does not only improve P nutrition, but also increases the assimilation of other nutrients such as Ca, K, Mg, Na, Al, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu (data not shown), clearly indicating that cluster root formation is a major mechanism for nutrient acquisition in the nutrient-poor fynbos.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>So far, little information exists on the mechanisms of P supply to native legumes of the fynbos.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Yet some of them have economic importance.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The 24 Cyclopia species, for example, are a source of Honeybush tea, a herbal beverage that is emerging as a major income earner that contributes about R12 million to the South African economy (DAFF, Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac20" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Similarly, some of the 281 Aspalathus species and most Leucadendron species are exported as cut wild flowers (Criley, 2000; Reinten et al., 2011), while A. linearis produces Rooibos tea, another herbal beverage that contributes about R500 million to the South African economy (Joubert and de Beer, 2011; http://www.busrep.co.za).</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac21" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>A. linearis is among the many species of the genus Aspalathus that is perceived to be suitable for phytoremediation (Kanu et al., 2013).</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot2" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>There is therefore a need to understand the mechanisms underlying P supply to native species in a very low P environment.</text></s>
