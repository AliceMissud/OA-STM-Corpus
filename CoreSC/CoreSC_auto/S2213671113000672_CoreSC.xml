Introduction
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation and aggregation of the pathological TAU protein in human brains (Hutton, 2000; Lee et al., 2001; Mandelkow and Mandelkow, 2012; Vossel and Miller, 2008).</text></s>
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>TAU, encoded by the MAPT gene on chromosome 17, is a microtubule binding protein that is highly expressed in neurons and predominantly located in neuronal axons (Goedert et al., 1989; Kosik et al., 1989; Morris et al., 2011; Neve et al., 1986).</text></s>

<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Tauopathies are also typical of other neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (Hutton, 2000; Lee et al., 2001; Mandelkow and Mandelkow, 2012; Vossel and Miller, 2008).</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Most FTD and PSP cases are sporadic, but a minority are familial (Weder et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>FTD and PSP syndromes can be caused by mutations in the MAPT gene that result in abnormal TAU phosphorylation and aggregation, leading to neurodegeneration.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Transgenic murine models of tauopathies have revealed fundamental insights into the disease (Lee et al., 2001; Mandelkow and Mandelkow, 2012), but their value as predictive preclinical models is unknown.</text></s>

<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>We demonstrate that isogenic TAU-iPSCs are not only useful for modeling tauopathies, but also for identifying unknown molecular mechanisms underlying the disease-causing mutations.</text></s>
