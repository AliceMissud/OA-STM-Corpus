Introduction
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The Eocene-Oligocene Transition (EOT) marks the onset of modern icehouse conditions when continental-scale ice sheets enveloped Antarctica ('Oi1,' ∼33.7Ma, Coxall et al., 2005; Ehrmann and Mackensen, 1992).</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Oi1 typifies the non-linearity of global climate, with the emplacement of an ice volume between 60% and 100% of that present today on Antarctica over only ∼400ka, superimposed on a million-year timescale cooling trend (Coxall et al., 2005; Lear et al., 2008; Zachos et al., 2001).</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Declining atmospheric pCO2 levels are thought to have driven the accelerated onset of Antarctic glaciation during Oi1, with numerical models suggesting a 'threshold' response of the cryosphere to a long-term lowering of pCO2 (DeConto and Pollard, 2003).</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Recent reconstruction of pCO2 across the late Eocene and early Oligocene (Pagani et al., 2011) documents a decline that began ∼2Ma prior to geological and stable isotope evidence for Antarctic glaciation, supporting this hypothesis.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, the mechanisms responsible for this gradual pCO2 drawdown remain unclear.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The biological carbon pump, in particular associated with increased diatom abundance in the Southern Ocean during the late Eocene, represents a potential candidate (Rabosky and Sorhannus, 2009; Salamy and Zachos, 1999; Scher and Martin, 2006).</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Diatoms are prolific phytoplankton, today accounting for up to 40% of global primary production (Tréguer et al., 1995).</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The formation of opaline frustules by diatoms imposes an absolute requirement for silicon, fundamentally linking the modern marine silicon and carbon cycles.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Among the phytoplankton, diatoms are notably important for the export and burial of organic carbon for a number of reasons.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Firstly, diatoms efficiently export carbon from the surface ocean: their silica frustules provide ballast material, they are relatively large cells at the base of short food webs, and they form blooms that can terminate in aggregation and mass settling of cells (Baines et al., 2010; Buesseler, 1998; Ragueneau et al., 2000; Smetacek, 1999).</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Secondly, diatoms may contribute up to 75% of primary production in upwelling regions of the world's oceans (Nelson et al., 1995).</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac19" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In these areas, nutrients and CO2 sequestered in the deep ocean by the biological pump are resupplied to the surface.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac20" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Diatom domination of the resident phytoplankton community makes them critical in determining the magnitude of the CO2 flux to the atmosphere and the efficiency of the biological pump (Marinov et al., 2006; Sarmiento et al., 2004).</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac21" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Today, diatom production in the Southern Ocean, coupled with the unique overturning circulation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), plays an important role in determining the efficiency of the biological pump and in setting the ocean-atmosphere CO2 balance.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac22" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The wind-driven ACC facilitates deep upwelling to the south of the Polar Front.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac23" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These upwelled waters are advected northwards by Ekman transport and thus provide nutrients that fuel diatom (as well as other phytoplankton) production, creating marked bands of opal and carbon export (Fig. 1; Speer et al., 2000; Ito et al., 2005).</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj2" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>These surface waters are eventually subducted to intermediate depths and supply nutrients to the lower latitude thermocline.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Thus, the amount and proportion of macronutrients used in this region play a major role in determining the efficiency of the biological pump globally (Sarmiento et al., 2004).</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Travelling an alternative path, some of this upwelled water moves southwards, eventually forming Antarctic Bottom Water.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res4" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The magnitude of phytoplankton production and export along this path relative to the degree of nutrient supply sets the degree to which CO2 escapes from the ocean.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Today, incomplete nutrient utilisation makes this a region of CO2 venting to the atmosphere (Marinov et al., 2006).</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Diatom radiation, coupled with the development of an ACC-type circulation, may have substantially increased the efficiency of the biological pump during the late Eocene and early Oligocene, facilitating organic carbon burial and contributing to the pCO2 drawdown hypothesised to have driven Antarctic Glaciation (Rabosky and Sorhannus, 2009; Scher and Martin, 2006).</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Diatoms originated in the Jurassic, and open ocean diatom diversity and abundance increased through the late Cretaceous and Palaeogene, pumping silicic acid to depth and driving a concomitant decrease in shelf chert abundance (Maliva et al., 1989).</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The late Eocene witnessed both a second diatom proliferation, culminating in an explosion of species diversity (Rabosky and Sorhannus, 2009) and enhanced Southern Ocean biogenic opal burial (Salamy and Zachos, 1999; Schumacher and Lazarus, 2004).</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>An increase in benthic δ13C, indicative of enhanced organic carbon burial, took place concomitantly (Cramer et al., 2009), particularly in the high latitude Southern Ocean.</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The opening of the two tectonic gateways that allow an unimpeded current flow in the Southern Ocean also occurred gradually through the late Eocene and into the Oligocene.</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Initial subsidence began between 50 (Drake Passage) and 35.5Ma (Tasman Gateway), with a deep connection completed by 33.5-30.2Ma (Livermore et al., 2007; Mackensen, 2004; Stickley et al., 2004).</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>From the time when these gateways opened, even to a relatively shallow depth, a complete pathway for wind-driven currents would have begun to affect Southern Ocean circulation, gradually intensifying upwelling as subsidence progressed (Livermore et al., 2007; Sijp et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The Late Eocene is thus hypothesised as the time when the important relationship between diatoms and the ACC developed.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Affirming the link between diatom radiation and late Eocene pCO2 drawdown requires evidence that diatom diversification and opal deposition corresponded to increased diatom productivity and organic carbon burial.</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj4" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>To this end, combined diatom and sponge silicon isotope records (δ30Si=[(30Si/28Si)Sample/(30Si/28Si)Standard-1]×103) are used here to characterise the late Eocene-early Oligocene marine silicon cycle.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Diatom δ30Si is a proxy for diatom silicic acid utilisation (Fig. 2a) because frustule growth preferentially incorporates 28Si over 30Si with 30ε∼-1.1‰ (De La Rocha et al., 1997).</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Silicic acid utilisation is determined by both diatom uptake (broadly reflecting diatom productivity) and silicic acid supply to the surface ocean.</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Although diatom δ30Si has previously been used to reconstruct silicic acid utilisation, efforts to convert this to productivity have been hampered by a lack of knowledge of the concentration of silicic acid supplied from depth.</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs3" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Benthic siliceous sponges form spicules with a silicon isotope fractionation factor dependent on ambient silicic acid concentration (Hendry et al., 2010; Hendry and Robinson, 2012; Fig. 2b).</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Sponge δ30Si constitutes a proxy for bottom-water silicic acid concentration and ocean circulation (Fig. 2b) which can be used as a constraint on the concentration of silicic acid supplied to the surface ocean, facilitating resolution of the effects upon diatom δ30Si of diatom uptake and silicic acid supply.</text></s>
Materials and methods

<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Diatom and sponge δ30Si were analysed in sediments from ODP Leg 177, Site 1090B, and ODP Leg 113, Site 689B, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 3).</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac24" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Age control for our records comes from magnetostratigraphic age models (Site 689; Florindo and Roberts, 2005; Spiess, 1990 and Site 1090; Channell et al., 2003) on the CK95 GPTS (Cande and Kent, 1995), which yield satisfactory correlation of benthic foraminiferan/bulk δ13C and δ18O (Cramer et al., 2009; Pusz et al., 2011) between sites given our sample resolution of 200-500kyr (Fig. A1).</text></s>

<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac26" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Initial sediment cleaning to extract biogenic opal followed well-established methodologies using H2O2, HCl and heavy liquid (sodium polytungstate) (Hendry and Rickaby, 2008; Morley et al., 2004; Shemesh et al., 1995).</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac27" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Opal was then separated into narrow size ranges using microfiltration (Minoletti et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac28" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Recent work has shown the 2-20μm fraction is generally most representative of diatom δ30Si (Egan et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>An initial test measuring the δ30Si of the 2-10μm, 10-20μm and 20-41μm size fractions from selected samples was conducted to establish the correct size fraction for targeting diatom δ30Si (Fig. 4).</text></s>
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Highest values in, and consistency between, the 2-10μm and 10-20μm fractions indicate these fractions best represent diatom δ30Si (Figs.</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res21" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>4 and 6), consistent with smear slide observations.</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met1" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Consequently, the 2-10μm size fraction was always analysed for diatom δ30Si.</text></s>
<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The 10-20μm fraction was additionally measured at given intervals to ensure diatom δ30Si values were not offset by low δ30Si silica components such as sponge spicules and radiolaria.</text></s>
<s sid="63"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>It is acknowledged that analysing smaller diatom size fractions may introduce a small seasonal or species-specific bias to measured diatom δ30Si values.</text></s>
<s sid="64"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res22" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However it is clear from the work of Egan et al. (2012) that this is of minimum concern compared to the effect of including larger size fractions, which are highly likely to contain non-diatom opal in the Southern Ocean.</text></s>
<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res23" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This is further attested to by the core top study of Ehlert et al. (2012), who found that opal in the 11-32μm size range in the Peruvian upwelling zone could be significantly offset from the δ30Si of handpicked diatom samples by non-diatom opal.</text></s>
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res24" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Selection of the smaller size fraction in this region is therefore essential to producing a δ30Si record that documents the target environmental parameter, silicic acid utilisation, rather than the amount of non-diatom contamination.</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp1" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>After microseparation, diatom opal was subjected to additional chemical cleaning following Ellwood and Hunter (1999), which included reduction (hydroxylamine hydrochloride/acetic acid solution), etching (NaF) and oxidation (strong acid solution of 50% HNO3+10% HCl).</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj5" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Three samples from Site 1090 covering the age range investigated were studied by X-ray diffractometry.</text></s>

<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met5" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Initial cleaning with H2O2 and HCl was carried out to concentrate biogenic opal.</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met6" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>From this pre-cleaned sample the &gt;100μm fraction was separated using microseparation (Minoletti et al., 2009) and between 50 and 100 spicules were hand-picked.</text></s>
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res25" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A range of spicule morphotypes were included, as it has been shown that neither spicule morphology nor species composition creates any consistent offset in δ30Si (Hendry et al., 2010, 2011).</text></s>

<s sid="89"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res29" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The size fractions analysed had up to 40% differences in the abundance of these diatoms (Fig. 5).</text></s>
<s sid="90"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res30" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, there is no detectable δ30Si offset between size fractions in the core tops TAN127 or 385 (Fig. 5a and b), whilst in KC08A (Fig. 5c), there is a slight negative offset of the 12-20μm fraction which is opposite to that expected if the abundance of Chaetoceros was the cause (the suggested larger fractionation would act to lower δ30Si in the smaller size fractions).</text></s>
<s sid="91"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res31" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Rather, the δ30Si values of size fractions between 2 and 20μm display a good correlation (r2=0.92, Fig. 2a) with surface silicic acid concentration and, where the water source δ30Si and silicic acid concentration are known or can be reasonably estimated, converge on an apparent 30ε of ∼-1‰ (Egan et al., 2012; Fripiat et al., 2011c).</text></s>
<s sid="92"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res32" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This suggests that whilst inter-specific differences in fractionation factor exist in culture, in the natural environment the presence of such species does not yield a large offset in the δ30Si signature of the diatom population as a whole.</text></s>
