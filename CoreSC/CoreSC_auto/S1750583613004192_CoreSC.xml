<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac22" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Unexplained aspects of the plume</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac23" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Firstly, there is a significant uncertainty concerning mass-balance estimates for the plume.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac24" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>To illustrate this, consider estimates for the uppermost layer alone, circa July 2002, equivalent to 5Mt injected, bearing in mind that the uppermost layer is the best constrained portion of the plume with respect to observational data (Chadwick et al., 2008).</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac25" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The CO2 volume in this layer is estimated to be approximately 110-165 thousand cubic meters (Chadwick et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac26" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Assuming an upper layer density of 426kg/m3 (after Bickle et al., 2007), this is equivalent to a mass of 0.05-0.07Mt.</text></s>
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac27" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Although Chadwick and co-workers (2009) favor the upper end of this range, 0.07Mt is considerably less than estimates of 0.11Mt (Bickle et al., 2007) and 0.16Mt (Singh et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac28" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This wide disparity in outcomes stems partly from (a) uncertainty concerning the plume temperature profile (Fig. 2a), with Singh and co-workers (2010) assuming a much colder plume with an uppermost layer density of 760kg/m3; and (b) poorly constrained assumptions regarding layer thickness (Fig. 2b), which are unresolvable at less than 15m thick given the seismic resolution (Arts et al., 2004).</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac29" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This uncertainty is further compounded by poorly constrained gas saturations for the plume layers.</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj4" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>All three aspects are discussed further below.</text></s>
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Secondly, despite the layer thickness uncertainty, the plume morphology indicates that column heights for trapped CO2 are unexpectedly low.</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The only published laboratory measurements for the caprock threshold pressure (Springer and Lindgren, 2006; Harrington et al., 2009), from a cored production well, 15/9A-11, close to the storage site, suggest a range of 1.6-1.9MPa, i.e. the fluid pressure necessary for CO2 to break through a low permeability rock.</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>If this range is applicable to the shale barriers within the Utsira Formation, such a scenario would result in CO2 column heights of hundreds of meters (Springer and Lindgren, 2006).</text></s>
<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>However, estimated column heights for the layered plume consistently fall within the range 7-14m (Chadwick et al., 2005, 2006; Bickle et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="63"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs3" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>These thin layers occur beneath all three-barrier types: (a) the 1-2m thin shales within the formation; (b) the uppermost 7m thick shale barrier; and (c) the much thicker Nordland Group shale caprock that forms the primary seal.</text></s>
<s sid="64"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Thirdly, the plume flow behavior is not indicative of sealing shale barriers punctuated by faults, holes or penetrated by a high permeability chimney or sand injectite (Zweigel et al., 2004), and the means of CO2 ascent is poorly understood.</text></s>
<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The plume initially ascended 200m vertically through the eight shale barriers in less than three years (Chadwick et al., 2006), resulting in a 'pancake stack' of layers.</text></s>
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>If the laterally extensive shales had acted as seals, preventing the vertical migration of CO2, the plume would have taken much longer to breakthrough, and its behavior would have been more akin to a 'zig-zag' distribution with lateral offsets, resulting from the CO2 tracking along the base of a barrier until encountering a hole through which to escape up to the next barrier, and then repeating this behavior.</text></s>
Mass balance estimates
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj5" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Addressing the mass balance question first, available areal mapping of the plume layers derived from time-lapse seismic reflection survey images (Bickle et al., 2007) are combined with layer-thickness estimates (Chadwick et al., 2009) to build a three-dimensional representation of the CO2 plume (Fig. 1).</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod5" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The approach assumes a flat gas-water contact for the plume layers, which implies that each layer has backfilled the trap as a gravitationally ponding fluid.</text></s>
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod6" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The model provides an insight into the volumetric relationship between layer thickness and mass balance (Fig. 2).</text></s>
<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod7" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Recent published estimates of volume and mass balance appear to have been primarily hampered by uncertainty in layer thickness and plume density (Fig. 2).</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac30" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For the uppermost layer, circa 2002, thickness estimates vary from 4 to 7m (Chadwick et al., 2005; Bickle et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac31" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The CO2 layers circa 2006 have recently been estimated as 10m thick (Lippard et al., 2008; Chadwick et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac32" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Both these estimates are thinner than the limit of phenomena resolvable by conventional seismic reflection surveys at this depth (Arts et al., 2004; Chadwick et al., 2006).</text></s>
<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac33" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>A case has been made for amplitude tuning of the Sleipner seismic to produce greater precision (Chadwick et al., 2006); however, the sensitivity of this seismic interpretation technique is such that the amplitude does not discriminate between layers more than 4m thick and less than 15m thick.</text></s>
<s sid="75"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac34" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Furthermore, the thin shale barriers within the aquifer are unresolvable on the baseline 1994 seismic (Arts et al., 2004) making tuning even more difficult.</text></s>
<s sid="76"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Published estimates of the CO2 volume in the top layer (110,000m3 from amplitude analysis, and 165,000m3 from structure) differ by 150% for the same seismic survey (Chadwick et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="77"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Although structure estimates are considered to be more reliable than amplitude (Chadwick et al., 2008), there is no method to discriminate between them.</text></s>
<s sid="78"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res21" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>An additional uncertainty arises from saturation profiling, which discerns between pores filled with brine and pores filled with CO2 above a poorly constrained level of saturation (Arts et al., 2004).</text></s>
<s sid="79"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res22" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It follows from the commonly used Gassmann equation (Gassmann, 1951) that: (a) very low saturations of less than a few percent are undetectable; (b) a strong correlation emerges as the gas saturation increases from a few percent to around thirty percent; and (c) for saturations much above thirty percent, it is difficult to distinguish between moderate and high saturations.</text></s>
<s sid="80"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res23" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It follows that the 80% gas saturation that is commonly assumed for the Sleipner plume, while reasonable (Chadwick et al., 2005; Bickle et al., 2007), remains uncertain (Lumley, 2008).</text></s>
<s sid="81"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res24" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>If the 80% assumption represents a reasonable upper limit to the mean saturation for the plume, the lower limit could be as low as 40%, halving mass balance estimates premised on the widely assumed high-saturation value.</text></s>
<s sid="82"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs4" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Finally, the liminal pressure and temperature conditions of the plume with respect to the critical point of CO2 (31°C and 7.4MPa) compound the uncertainty.</text></s>
<s sid="83"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs5" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The ambient temperature at the injection depth is reasonably well constrained at 41±1°C (Bickle et al., 2007); however, the temperature at the top of the plume is much more poorly constrained at around 34±3°C (Singh et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="84"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res25" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This results in a potential density range for CO2 in the uppermost layer of 300-700kg/m3; a mid-range scenario is assumed, with a temperature of 35°C at the caprock and a linear geothermal gradient to the injection depth at 41°C for the flow simulations that follow (orange diamonds, Fig. 2a).</text></s>
<s sid="85"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res26" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, a brief consideration of different thickness and density scenarios (assuming 80% saturation) with respect to the solution space for mass balance (gray area, Fig. 2b) suggests that a cold high-density plume requires an upper layer that is at least 8-9m thick, circa July 2002 and 5Mt injected; while a hot low-density plume exceeds a mass balance with layers that are greater than 13m thick.</text></s>
<s sid="86"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res27" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The uppermost layer thickness necessary for a mass balance, circa July 2002 and 5Mt injected, lies in the range 8-13m.</text></s>
<s sid="87"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Consequently, these compounded uncertainties in mass balance (layer thickness, gas saturation and gas density) are highly sensitive to small changes in assumptions that are unresolvable by remote geophysical monitoring given the broadly constrained fields of pressure, temperature and saturation.</text></s>
<s sid="88"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Although an accurate mass balance estimate would be desirable to confirm site integrity with respect to the present-day caprock behavior, this aspect of Sleipner is likely to remain elusive due to the uncertainties inherent in remote geophysical monitoring of gas plumes.</text></s>
Modeling methodology
<s sid="89"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con3" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>To better understand the mass balance, spatial distribution and flow behavior of the plume, a numerical flow model of the storage site is constructed.</text></s>

<s sid="318"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con79" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is postulated that the fracturing occurred long before CO2 injection commenced, as a result of rapid pore pressure fluctuations associated with the collapse of thick ice sheets during multiple episodes of deglaciation in the region over the last million years.</text></s>
