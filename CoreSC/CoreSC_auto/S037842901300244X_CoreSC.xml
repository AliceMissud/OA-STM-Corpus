<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, the diversity of the farming systems and of the parasite have rendered the use of a single control method ineffective, leading to the development of integrated Striga control packages that combine several control measures (e.g., Badu-Apraku, 2010).</text></s>
