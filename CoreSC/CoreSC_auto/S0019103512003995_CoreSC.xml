Introduction
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The detection of H, O, C+, and Si2+ in the upper atmosphere of HD209458b (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003, 2004; Linsky et al., 2010), and the tentative detection of H in the upper atmosphere of HD189733b (Lecavelier des Etangs et al., 2010) and Mg+ in the upper atmosphere of WASP-12b (Fossati et al., 2010) are among the most exciting recent discoveries related to the atmospheres of extrasolar giant planets (EGPs).</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The observations demonstrate that the upper atmospheres of close-in EGPs such as HD209458b differ significantly from the thermospheres of the giant planets in the Solar System.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>They are much hotter, they extend to several planetary radii and instead of molecular hydrogen, they are primarily composed of atoms and atomic ions.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The detection of heavy atoms and ions such as O, C+, Si2+, and Mg+ implies that the atmospheres of close-in EGPs are not always affected by diffusive separation.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con3" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>A likely explanation is that diffusive separation of the heavy atoms and ions is prevented by momentum transfer collisions with the rapidly escaping light atoms and ions.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Mass fractionation during hydrodynamic escape is believed to have played an important role in the early evolution of the atmospheres of the terrestrial planets (e.g., Zahnle and Kasting, 1986; Hunten et al., 1987) but it cannot be observed in action anywhere in the Solar System.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Observations of EGP atmospheres thus provide a unique opportunity to study this phenomenon that should lead to a better understanding of evolutionary processes in our own Solar System.</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Extended thermospheres give rise to large transit depths in UV transmission spectra.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, they are also potentially detectable in optical and infrared spectra.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For instance, Coustenis et al. (1997, 1998) searched for an exosphere around 51 Peg b in the near-IR.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In line with the current understanding, they suggested that the exospheres of close-in EGPs such as 51 Peg b are hot and composed primarily of atoms and ions.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>They also argued that hydrodynamic escape can lead to the escape of heavier species, and give rise to large in-transit absorption by such species in optical and near-IR spectra.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, 51 Peg b is not a transiting planet and the search for an exosphere around it was not successful.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>On the other hand, once the transit of HD209458b was first detected (Charbonneau et al., 2000; Henry et al., 2000), similar searches on this planet were also undertaken.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Moutou et al. (2001) looked for absorption by species such as Na,H,He,CH+,CO+,N2+, and H2O+ in the upper atmosphere of HD209458b.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These observations were followed by Moutou et al. (2003) who attempted to measure the transit depth in the He 1083nm line that was predicted to be significant by Seager and Sasselov (2000).</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The most recent searches were reported by Winn et al. (2004) and Narita et al. (2005) who looked for transits in the Na D, Li, Hα, Hβ, Hγ, Fe, and Ca absorption lines.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>So far none of the ground-based searches have led to a detection of the upper atmosphere.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, the non-detection is based on only a few observations that have proven difficult to analyze, and the search should continue.</text></s>

<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This detection was based on four transits observed with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) (Brown et al., 2001).</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The same data were later reanalyzed by Sing et al. (2008a,b) who combined them with other observations (Knutson et al., 2007) and created a transmission spectrum of HD209458b at wavelengths of 300-800nm.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod1" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>They argued that the abundance of sodium in the atmosphere is depleted above the 3mbar level either by condensation into Na2S clouds or ionization.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We note that the detection of Si2+ in the thermosphere (Linsky et al., 2010) constrains cloud formation mechanisms in the upper atmosphere and implies that the depletion of Na at low pressures is probably due to ionization (see Section 3.3).</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The atmosphere of HD209458b has also been observed several times in the infrared with the Spitzer space telescope.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met5" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Deming et al. (2005) detected the secondary eclipse of the planet at 24μm by using the Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS).</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met6" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Together with similar observations of TrES-1 at 4.5 and 8.0μm obtained by Charbonneau et al.

<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>They were followed by Richardson et al. (2007) who observed the infrared emission spectrum of HD209458b between 7.5 and 13.2μm with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS).</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs3" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>This spectrum was reanalyzed by Swain et al. (2008) who noted that it is largely featureless with some evidence for an unidentified spectral feature between 7.5 and 8.5μm.</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Knutson et al. (2008) used IRAC to observe the secondary eclipse of HD209458b in the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0μm bands.</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>They observed a higher than expected flux in the 4.5 and 5.8μm bands and interpreted this as evidence for the presence of a stratospheric temperature inversion that gives rise to strong water emission at these wavelengths.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Beaulieu et al. (2010) observed the transit of the planet in the same wavelength bands and also found evidence for the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere.</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The detection of water vapor is also supported by Swain et al.

<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In addition to water vapor, the NICMOS observations revealed the presence of methane and carbon dioxide in the emission spectrum.</text></s>
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These detections provide valuable clues to the overall composition of the atmosphere but the uncertainties in the data and degeneracies between temperature and abundances in the forward model prevent a more quantitative characterization of the density and temperature profiles.</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met7" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In general, difficulties associated with reducing the data and the need to describe a few uncertain data points with models of growing complexity has led to disagreements on the analysis and interpretation of transmission and secondary eclipse data on different exoplanets.</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met8" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The same is true of the FUV transit observations of HD209458b.</text></s>

<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met11" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>1 Based on the data, they argued that the planet is followed by a cometary tail of escaping hydrogen atoms that are accelerated to velocities in excess of 100kms-1 by stellar radiation pressure (see also Schneider et al., 1998).</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met12" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Later, Vidal-Madjar et al. (2004) used the STIS G140L low resolution grating to detect absorption by H, O and C+ in the upper atmosphere, and argued that the atmosphere of HD209458b escapes hydrodynamically.</text></s>
<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met13" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Linsky et al. (2010) used the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on HST to confirm the detection of C+ and reported on the detection of Si2+ around the planet.</text></s>

<s sid="64"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met15" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Ben-Jaffel (2007, 2008) disagreed with the interpretation of the G140M observations.</text></s>
<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met16" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>He reanalyzed the G140M data and argued that the 15% H Lyman α transit depth was exaggerated because the data were partly corrupted by short-term variability of the host star and geocoronal Lyman α emissions.</text></s>
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>He also showed that there is no evidence for a cometary tail in the data, and that absorption by H in the extended thermosphere of the planet can explain the observations.</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac20" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini (2010) reanalyzed the G140L data and reached a similar conclusion regarding H (see also Koskinen et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac21" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini (2010) fitted the H Lyman α observations by scaling the density profiles from the model of Garcia Munoz (2007), and argued that suprathermal O and C+ are required to fit the transit depths in the O I and C II lines.</text></s>
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac22" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>They did not explain how the suprathermal atoms form and simply chose their properties to fit the observations.</text></s>

<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac25" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Instead, they suggested that the observed absorption arises from a cloud of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) that form by charge exchange between the protons in the stellar wind and the escaping hydrogen.</text></s>
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac26" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In their model, the observed absorption reflects the velocity of the stellar wind, and the data can potentially be used to characterize the magnetosphere of the planet.</text></s>
<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac27" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Ekenbäck et al. (2010) recently updated the model to include a more realistic description of the escaping atmosphere and stellar wind properties.</text></s>
<s sid="75"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac28" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, both studies ignored absorption by H in the thermosphere, which is significant, and did not attempt to explain the presence of heavier atoms and ions such as O, C+, and Si2+ in the escaping atmosphere.</text></s>
<s sid="76"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac29" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>All of the interpretations of the UV transit data require that HD209458b has a hot and extended thermosphere.</text></s>

<s sid="83"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa3" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>In order to do so, we developed a new one-dimensional escape model for the upper atmosphere of HD209458b that includes the photochemistry of heavy atoms and ions, and a more realistic description of heating efficiencies.</text></s>
