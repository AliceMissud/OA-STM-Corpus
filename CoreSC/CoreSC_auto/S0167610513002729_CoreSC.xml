Introduction
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Understanding dispersion processes in urban areas is important for modelling air quality as well as pollution from accidental or terrorist releases.</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot2" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>The chaotic nature of turbulent flow and the complexity of the building geometry both contribute to making such modelling non-trivial.</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Urban geometry affects the mean flow and turbulence significantly (Barlow and Coceal, 2009) and thereby exerts a strong control on dispersion processes (Belcher, 2005).</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For localised releases, such effects are particularly important in the near-field region (here defined as within a few building blocks of the release), where conventional models such as Gaussian plume models fail (Belcher et al., 2013).</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In this region, certain characteristics of the dispersion become significant, although they are usually justifiably neglected further downstream.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Recently, Wood et al. (2009) reported above-background dosages within 6-8 times the building height in all directions around the source in field experiments in central London.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot3" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>But comprehensive data and understanding on these near-field dispersion aspects are currently lacking.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj4" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The present paper is an attempt to document such near-field aspects for simple urban-like geometries, where their effects can be more easily isolated and therefore better understood.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj5" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Specifically, the main questions investigated here are the following:</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj6" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>• What are the main characteristics of near-field dispersion from localised sources in urban areas?</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj7" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>• How are they related to the underlying flow structure around the buildings?</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj8" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>• How do the mean concentration and concentration fluctuations vary in the near field?</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj9" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>These questions are explored by analysing data from the recent direct numerical simulations (DNS) reported in Branford et al. (2011) and new simulations presented here.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj10" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>These simulations involve the continuous release of a passive scalar from localised ground-level sources within a regular array of cubes.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj11" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The effect of different flow directions, obstacle layout and source location is investigated.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The paper is structured as follows.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj12" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In Section 2, we elaborate on the methodology and the cases studied.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj13" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Results are presented in Section 3, which first looks at the instantaneous and mean flow field; the scalar field is then explored by looking at the instantaneous and mean concentration patterns, concentration profiles and time series.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Conclusions are presented in Section 4.</text></s>
Method
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met1" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The numerical technique for solving the Navier-Stokes equations in the DNS is described in Yao et al. (2001) and Coceal et al. (2006).</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In brief, the equations are discretized using second-order central finite differences in space and a second-order Adams-Bashforth scheme in time, based on the pressure correction method.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The Poisson equation for pressure is solved by a multigrid method.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The code is parallelized using Message Passing Interface (MPI).</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj14" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Branford et al. (2011) performed a series of DNS for different wind directions (0°, 30° and 45°) over a regular array of cubical obstacles of height H.</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj15" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The domain size was 16H x 16H×16H in the horizontal and 8H in the vertical - see Fig. 1a and b.</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj16" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In the present paper we analyse data from the 0° and 45° runs.</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj17" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Additionally, we present results for new simulations done for flow at an angle of 45° over a smaller staggered array of domain size 8H x 8H×8H x 8H×8H - see Fig. 1c.</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj18" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Comparison with simulations over a larger staggered array of domain size 16H x 12H×12H x 8H×8H (Coceal et al., 2007) revealed similar turbulence statistics; hence, since the emphasis here is on near-source dispersion, the size of the present domain is adequate.</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met5" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>All the simulations were conducted under conditions of neutral stability and fully rough turbulent flow.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met6" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Periodic boundary conditions were imposed in the horizontal directions, effectively simulating flow over an infinite array of cubes.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met7" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The Reynolds number based on the velocity at the top of the domain and the cube height was typically between 4750 and 7000.</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>While this is much less than Reynolds numbers at full scale, it is comparable to typical Reynolds numbers achieved in many wind tunnel experiments.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Numerical tests showed that a grid resolution of H/32 was sufficient, producing flow and concentration statistics that agreed with test runs at double the resolution (H/64) to within a few percent (Coceal et al., 2006, Branford et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod1" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Based on the wall friction velocity uτ and the cube dimension H, a non-dimensional time scale characterizing the turnover time of eddies shed from the cubes can be defined as T=H/uτ.</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod2" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The simulations were run with a time step of 0.00025T, spun up for a duration of approximately 200T to allow fully developed turbulence conditions and statistics were collected over an interval of approximately 100T.</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj19" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The simulations for the larger arrays typically took a few weeks in total to run on 124 dual-core 2.5GHz PowerPC 970MP processors.</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj20" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In this study we investigate the dispersion of a passive scalar, which is modelled by numerically solving the scalar transport equation using an Eulerian approach.</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod3" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Point sources are discretized as Gaussian balls over a few grid points.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod4" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The Schmidt number is fixed at one in all the simulations.</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met8" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>A sponge layer is applied to the scalar field around the domain to prevent the scalar from re-entering the domain due to the periodic boundary conditions.</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met9" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The scalar is allowed to freely escape at the top of the domain.</text></s>
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Further details are given in Branford et al. (2011).</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs3" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The scalar is released continuously and at a steady rate from an ensemble of point sources close to the ground (at z=0.0625H) within the simulated urban area; the source locations are indicated in Fig. 1.</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The sources in both cases (a) and (b) are placed in equivalent locations, therefore they form an ensemble of equivalent releases and ensemble averaging can be performed to extend the time series of each individual release.</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs4" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>In case (c) the flow is not symmetrical because of the staggered arrangement of the cubes.</text></s>
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Here the sources are in three different locations: behind a cube (3 equivalent locations), in front of a cube (3 equivalent locations) and in the space between two cubes (1 location).</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Near-source dispersion is sensitive to the building geometry and it is therefore impossible to perform a comprehensive study of the influence that specific urban geometrical features have on the dispersion.</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Our motivation, therefore, is to gain insight into generic features of the dispersion patterns and how they are influenced by the flow structure in simple commonly-occurring urban setups.</text></s>
<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa3" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The choice of these different configurations allows us to look at the effect of wind direction, building layout and source location on dispersion in a simple but plausible setup.</text></s>
<s sid="63"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs5" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Detailed comparisons of mean concentration profiles at different locations within and above the array showed good agreement with data from a water-channel experiment (Hilderman and Chong, 2007) on the same configuration of cubical buildings, as reported in Branford et al. (2011).</text></s>
<s sid="64"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met10" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Mean flow and turbulence statistics were compared extensively with wind tunnel data in Coceal et al. (2006, 2007).</text></s>

Results and discussion
The flow field
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met12" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Dispersion within a building array is heavily influenced by the flow structure and how it varies in space and time.</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met13" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>We therefore begin by surveying the spatial and temporal variation of the flow field.</text></s>
Instantaneous flow patterns
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs6" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>To form an idea of the instantaneous flow field, Figs. 2 and 3 show wind vector snapshots for the aligned array for the two wind directions of 0° and 45° at four different heights, corresponding to values of z/H of 0.23, 0.52, 0.80 and 1.08.</text></s>
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs7" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>For clarity, in these and other vector plots, vectors are only shown at every fourth grid point.</text></s>
<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj21" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>We adopt a Cartesian coordinate system in which the x coordinate is directed from left to right (along the mean forcing direction for the 0° case), the y coordinate points upwards and along the plane of the paper and the z coordinate points vertically out of the paper.</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod5" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The corresponding instantaneous velocity components are u, v and w, with mean components denoted by U, V and W and fluctuating components denoted by u′, v′ and w′ respectively.</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod6" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The instantaneous, mean and fluctuating components of the scalar concentration field are denoted by c, C and c′ respectively.</text></s>
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs8" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Fig. 2 shows that the instantaneous pattern is quite complex, even for this simple configuration.</text></s>
<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs9" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Broadly speaking, two main flow patterns can be discerned in these plots: a recirculation in the wake region behind the cubes with generally low velocity and a faster channelling flow along the unobstructed channels between alternate rows of cubes.</text></s>
<s sid="75"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, on an instantaneous basis, the flow in these channels is far from being linear along the direction of the forcing.</text></s>
<s sid="76"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs10" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Rather, the wind vectors change direction continuously and unpredictably, especially around the intersections.</text></s>
<s sid="77"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>A consequence of the highly unsteady character of the turbulent flow in this complex geometry is that individual flow realisations may behave in somewhat unintuitive ways.</text></s>
<s sid="78"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs11" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>For example, at z=0.23H there is a swirling motion in the intersection region which drives faster fluid at an angle into the downstream section of the upper channel (Fig. 2a).</text></s>
<s sid="79"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs12" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Elsewhere, for example in the upstream section of the lower channel at z=0.52H (Fig. 2b), much of the flow diverts into the side 'street' behind the building wake instead of proceeding downstream along the channel as one might expect.</text></s>
<s sid="80"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs13" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Such intermittent flow features drive turbulent exchanges between the channels along the forcing direction and the 'streets' perpendicular to it.</text></s>
<s sid="81"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs14" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Further up at z=0.80H (Fig. 2c) the flow pattern along the lower channel meanders between the alternate rows of buildings.</text></s>
<s sid="82"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs15" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Clearly then, there is significant vertical variation in the structure of the flow too.</text></s>
<s sid="83"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs16" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Even above the array at z=1.08H (Fig. 2d) the wind vector pattern is still horizontally inhomogeneous.</text></s>
<s sid="84"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs17" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Fig. 3 shows that the patterns of wind vector snapshots for the 45° flow are again quite complex.</text></s>
<s sid="85"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The array is laterally symmetric with respect to the flow direction of 45°, but at any particular instant, the actual flow pattern is non-symmetrical.</text></s>
<s sid="86"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Again, the flow structure is different at different heights.</text></s>
<s sid="87"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Hence, the flow is highly inhomogeneous and three-dimensional spatially and unsteady in time.</text></s>
<s sid="88"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The unsteadiness is accentuated by the intermittent character of the recirculations behind the leeward faces of the cubes.</text></s>
<s sid="89"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs18" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>For example, at z=0.23H there is a recirculation behind the eastward face of the cube on the lower left but none on the northward face.</text></s>
<s sid="90"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs19" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Above the array at 1.08H, the flow is broadly in the direction of the forcing on average, but there are strong deviations associated with flow around the cube tops.</text></s>
<s sid="91"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs20" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Similar observations on the asymmetry and unsteadiness of the instantaneous flow patterns can be made for the staggered array (not shown).</text></s>
Mean flow structure: horizontal
<s sid="92"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs21" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The time-averaged flow structure in the aligned array for the two forcing directions of 0° and 45° and in the staggered array for 45° are shown in Fig. 4.</text></s>
<s sid="93"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs22" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Streamlines are plotted in horizontal planes at two different heights of z=0.12H and 0.73H for each configuration.</text></s>
<s sid="94"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs23" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Fig. 4a and b shows the streamlines for a 0° flow.</text></s>
<s sid="95"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs24" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The implicit averaging over many instantaneous realisations has removed much of the small scale complexity in the flow pattern and emphasized the two main features identified earlier, namely large recirculations within the 'canyon' region behind the buildings and a channelling flow in the open 'street' region between the rows of cubes.</text></s>
<s sid="96"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The streamlines within this channelling region appear much more linear now and look similar at the two heights within the array.</text></s>
<s sid="97"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In contrast, the structure of the recirculations changes with height, indicating that the building wake has a three-dimensional structure (Goulart, 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="98"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs25" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Fig. 4c and d shows the flow structure for the flow at 45° over the aligned array.</text></s>
<s sid="99"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs26" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>There is a recirculation behind each face of the cubes, symmetrically disposed with respect to the 45° diagonal line through the cubes.</text></s>
<s sid="100"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The recirculations reduce in size with height.</text></s>
<s sid="101"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Streamlines from the two perpendicular streets upstream of the intersection come together and then diverge around the corner of the next building at the intersection, part of them feeding into a recirculation on the leeward face of the upstream buildings in the street perpendicular to the original flow direction and another part channelling into the far side of that same street.</text></s>
<s sid="102"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>As we shall see, both of these flow features play an important role in near-source dispersion.</text></s>
<s sid="103"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res21" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Firstly, the diverging streamlines around the building corner lead to considerable mean transport into lateral streets and thereby enhance horizontal (lateral) dispersion, a process known as 'topological dispersion' (Davidson et al., 1995, Belcher, 2005).</text></s>
<s sid="104"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con3" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Secondly, the recirculations trap material and release them on a slower timescale (Vincent, 1978) higher up and into the flow above the array.</text></s>
<s sid="105"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The relative roles of the recirculations and the channelling flow change with increasing height, as the recirculations reduce in size, coupled with stronger mean flow into the side streets.</text></s>
<s sid="106"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res22" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Fig. 4e and f shows the corresponding pattern of streamlines for flow at 45° over the staggered array.</text></s>
<s sid="107"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res23" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Staggering the cube rows in the streamwise direction means that the flow is no longer symmetrical with respect to the 45° diagonal line through the array.</text></s>
<s sid="108"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res24" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This asymmetry modifies the details of the flow topology drastically, but broadly similar structural elements can be identified as in the aligned array.</text></s>
<s sid="109"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res25" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>There are now two recirculations behind one leeward face of the cube and a smaller one on the other leeward face.</text></s>
<s sid="110"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res26" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The streamlines still diverge around the cubes, but now do so around a cube face rather than around a corner.</text></s>
<s sid="111"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res27" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The exact location at which this occurs depends on height, being different at z=0.12H and z=0.73H.</text></s>
<s sid="112"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res28" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>As for the aligned array, the recirculations are weaker and the channelling flow is stronger in the gaps further up.</text></s>
Mean flow structure: vertical
<s sid="113"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Given that the flow field is three-dimensional, particularly when the flow direction is oblique, it is instructive to look at its structure in a vertical plane.</text></s>
<s sid="114"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs27" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Fig. 5 shows the locations of eight vertical y-z planes through the aligned and staggered arrays at values of x/H of 0.02, 0.14, 0.39, 0.64, 1.02, 1.14, 1.39 and 1.64.</text></s>
<s sid="115"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs28" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Fig. 6 shows a sequence of mean wind vector plots in these vertical planes for the aligned array for 45° flow.</text></s>
<s sid="116"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res29" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Since the array is regular, the same patterns repeat in other units.</text></s>
<s sid="117"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res30" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Also, due to symmetry about the 45° axis, the same pattern applies to the (u, w) wind vectors in corresponding x-z planes.</text></s>
<s sid="118"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs29" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The salient features of the flow at these different locations are summarised below.</text></s>
<s sid="119"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs30" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>• At x=0.02H (close to the entry into the 'street', Fig. 6a), there is a strong flow component towards the downstream side of the street canyon.</text></s>

<s sid="236"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is noteworthy that there is not much material above the source cell at all.</text></s>
<s sid="237"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Hence, little material is detrained into the air directly above the source.</text></s>
<s sid="238"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>There is more material above the location of the secondary sources.</text></s>
<s sid="239"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con19" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This is consistent with the picture that material released at the initial source location moves horizontally into the wake region of adjacent buildings where it is then pushed up by the updraft flow visualised in Section 3.1.3 and then spread by the faster flow above the array.</text></s>
<s sid="240"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res106" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Due to this faster flow, the whole pattern is displaced downstream relative to the pattern in the array below.</text></s>

Conclusions
<s sid="242"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa4" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>In this study we have analysed data from direct numerical simulations to document the effect of buildings on near-source dispersion for three case studies with different wind directions, building layout and source location.</text></s>
<s sid="243"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res107" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The analysis has highlighted the following aspects of near-field dispersion:</text></s>
<s sid="244"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res108" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>• Dispersion is strongly affected by the presence of buildings in the near field.</text></s>
<s sid="245"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con20" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>First, diverging streamlines around buildings lead to considerable mean transport and enhance lateral dispersion.</text></s>
<s sid="246"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con21" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Secondly, trapping and re-release of material in the wakes of buildings in the immediate vicinity of the release gives rise to secondary sources.</text></s>
<s sid="247"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This appears to be a ubiquitous phenomenon, at least in the relatively high packing density regime investigated here, which is characteristic of city centres.</text></s>
<s sid="248"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Without knowledge of these secondary sources, erroneous modelling assumptions might be made based purely on the initial location of the release.</text></s>
<s sid="249"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In an emergency response scenario involving accidental or terrorist releases this could be critical.</text></s>
<s sid="250"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con25" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>• These near-field dispersion characteristics derive from the underlying flow structure around the buildings, which exerts a strong influence in the near field where there is a higher concentration of material.</text></s>
<s sid="251"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con26" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The detailed flow topology depends on the wind direction and building layout, but salient features such as diverging streamlines and wake recirculations are robust.</text></s>
<s sid="252"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con27" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The three-dimensional structure of these flow features is especially pertinent and needs to be taken into account in models that aim to predict near-field concentrations.</text></s>
<s sid="253"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con28" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>• The levels of concentration fluctuations within and directly above the building arrays depend significantly on location around the source.</text></s>
<s sid="254"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res109" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>High levels of concentration fluctuations are found in the very near field, in open channels and immediately above the buildings.</text></s>
<s sid="255"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res110" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>An order of magnitude estimate for the fluctuation intensity is between 2 and 5 in the near field.</text></s>
<s sid="256"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con29" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These results could be incorporated for example in semi-empirical models of concentration fluctuations (e.g. Cierco et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="257"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con30" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These results are valuable for informing the development and validation of simple models of dispersion that could perform better than current approaches in the near-field region.</text></s>
<s sid="258"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con31" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In this context, incorporating some of the current findings into street network models (Soulhac, 2000; Belcher, 2005; Hamlyn et al., 2007) offers an especially promising possibility.</text></s>
<s sid="259"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con32" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Preliminary work in this respect has been performed by the authors and is reported in Goulart (2012) and Belcher et al. (2013).</text></s>
<s sid="260"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con33" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Ongoing work is focusing on extending the capabilities of such models to predicting near-field dispersion by accounting for wake sources and three-dimensional effects.</text></s>
<s sid="261"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con34" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Statistical analysis of concentration fluctuations will also help to develop and validate a stochastic version of the network model.</text></s>
<s sid="262"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con35" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Finally, inverse modelling using empirical data such as the present datasets can be used to infer optimal parameters for the street network model.</text></s>
