Introduction
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Charcoal rot of soybean, caused by Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goidanich, is one of the most important soilborne pathogens, infecting over 500 plant species in more than 100 plant families around the world (Smith and Wyllie, 1999).</text></s>
