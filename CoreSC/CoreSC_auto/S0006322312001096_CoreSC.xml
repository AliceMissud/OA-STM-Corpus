<s sid="2"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj1" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>We examined whether standard clinical risk profiles developed for vascular diseases also predict depressive symptoms in older adults.</text></s>
Methods
<s sid="3"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Data were drawn from the Whitehall II study with baseline examination in 1991; follow-up screenings in 1997, 2003, and 2008; and additional disease ascertainment from hospital data and registry linkage on 5318 participants (mean age 54.8 years, 31% women) without depressive symptoms at baseline.</text></s>

<s sid="5"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res1" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>New depressive symptoms at each follow-up screening were identified by General Health Questionnaire caseness, a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score ≥16, and use of antidepressant medication.</text></s>
Results
<s sid="6"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res2" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Diagnosed vascular disease (that is, coronary heart disease or stroke) was associated with an increased risk for depressive symptoms, age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios from 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.0-2.2) to 2.0 (1.4-3.0), depending on the indicator of depressive symptoms.</text></s>
<s sid="7"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Among participants without manifest vascular disease, the Stroke Risk Score was associated with Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale depressive symptoms before age 65 (age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio per 10% absolute change in the score = 3.1 [1.5-6.5]), but none of the risk scores predicted new-onset depressive symptoms in those aged ≥65 (odds ratios from .8 to 1.2).</text></s>
Conclusions
<s sid="8"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res4" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These data suggest that public health measures to improve vascular risk status will influence the incidence of later-life depressive symptoms via reduced rates of manifest vascular disease.</text></s>

Subsidiary Analysis

Discussion
<s sid="114"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res52" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This longitudinal study of British adults shows that manifest cardiovascular disease (CHD and stroke) is associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms.</text></s>
<s sid="115"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res53" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>There was also some evidence to suggest an association between higher Framingham stroke risk score and increased onset of depressive symptoms before the age of 65 years.</text></s>
<s sid="116"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res54" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, the vascular risk scores did not predict later-life depressive symptoms among persons with no manifest vascular disease or history of depression.</text></s>
<s sid="117"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met28" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This finding was based on data from three different vascular risk prediction algorithms-the Framingham CVD, CHD, and stroke scores-and depressive symptoms measured using two survey instruments and information on use of antidepressant medication.</text></s>
<s sid="118"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res55" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The association between manifest vascular disease and increased risk of depressive symptoms is in agreement with previous studies (6,34-38).</text></s>
<s sid="119"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res56" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The onset of depressive symptoms in those with manifest vascular disease may be the result of vascular pathology, but it is also possible that the diagnosis of a pernicious chronic disease per se and its impact on quality of life induces depressed mood.</text></s>
<s sid="120"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res57" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The second of these explanations is supported in our study by results showing an equally strong and consistent association between long-term nonvascular diseases (excluding vascular comorbidity) and the risk of subsequent depressive symptoms.</text></s>
<s sid="121"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res58" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Indeed, depressive symptoms in the elderly may be a correlate of various disabling conditions (e.g., chronic lung disease, loss of hearing, and loss of vision) (4) in addition to diseases of a vascular origin.</text></s>
<s sid="122"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Physiological impact of both vascular and nonvascular disease on inflammatory, endocrine, and immune systems may increase vulnerability to depressive symptoms (39,40).</text></s>
<s sid="123"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con3" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Validated multifactorial risk prediction algorithms, such as the Framingham risk scores, and objective measures of atherosclerosis are used to determine preclinical vascular risk status (41,42).</text></s>
<s sid="124"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study of a middle-aged population on the association between Framingham risk scores and later-life depressive symptoms.</text></s>
<s sid="125"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These scores alone did not predict the onset of depressive symptoms at age 65 or older, although the stroke risk score was associated with the onset of depressive symptoms at younger ages.</text></s>
<s sid="126"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con6" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These results were apparent in age- and sex-adjusted and multivariably adjusted models but were weaker in unadjusted models, possibly because greater age and male sex increased the stroke risk score but were related to a lower risk of depressive symptoms in that age range.</text></s>
<s sid="127"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp2" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>The association between stroke risk and depressive symptoms warrants further research, as it raises the possibility that cerebrovascular rather than cardiovascular risk status may act as an early marker of depression risk.</text></s>
<s sid="128"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res59" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A few previous studies have examined the longitudinal association between overall vascular risk and later-life depression using other indicators of vascular risk status.</text></s>
<s sid="129"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res60" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In the Health, Aging and Body Composition study of adults aged 70 or higher, a score combining selected vascular risk factors (body mass index, metabolic syndrome, smoking, and ankle arm index) and vascular diseases predicted higher 2-year incidence of elevated depressive symptoms (7).</text></s>
<s sid="130"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res61" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, the extent to which this association was attributable to vascular risk factors alone is difficult to assess in such a study design.</text></s>
<s sid="131"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res62" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In the Rotterdam study of older adults followed up for 6 years (11), none of the objective atherosclerosis measures was linked with subsequent depression.</text></s>
<s sid="132"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res63" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This null finding was evident irrespective of whether assessment of depression was based on CES-D or a clinical diagnosis obtained from a psychiatric interview (11).</text></s>
<s sid="133"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res64" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Similarly, in the Leiden 85+ prospective cohort study, ratings of generalized atherosclerosis were not associated with depressive symptoms (43).</text></s>
<s sid="134"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con7" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In light of this study, as well as data from previous longitudinal studies (11,43), unfavorable preclinical vascular status is not an independent risk factor for later-life depressive symptoms.</text></s>
<s sid="135"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con8" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is possible that the hypothesized vascular origin of depression in older adults is driven by severe clinical vascular pathology and therefore apparent only in relation to manifest disease or that vascular disease is a correlate rather than cause of depressive symptoms in later life (44-47).</text></s>
<s sid="136"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con9" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Later-life depressive symptoms may also be a heterogeneous multietiological disorder and depression resulting from vascular pathology only a small subset of all later-life depressive disorders in older people.</text></s>
<s sid="137"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res65" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This would lead any association between vascular risk factors and overall later-life depressive symptoms to be diluted, an explanation in keeping with a recent prospective population-based study that showed no significant association between later-life depression and cerebrovascular pathology in postmortem data (48).</text></s>
Limitations
<s sid="138"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res66" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>There are caveats to the results reported here.</text></s>
<s sid="139"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res67" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We measured depressive symptoms using validated instruments, such as the General Health Questionnaire and CES-D, and information on prescribed antidepressant medication use (26,29,49).</text></s>
<s sid="140"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con10" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These instruments are not designed to make a psychiatric diagnosis of first or recurrent major depression (26,29); they defined only partially overlapping case populations and some misclassification occurred because antidepressants are also prescribed for conditions other than depression.</text></s>
<s sid="141"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con11" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Nevertheless, the associations of manifest CHD and stroke with depressive symptoms in our study are in agreement with previous research linking vascular disease to depressive symptoms and clinical depression (4,35-38,44).</text></s>
<s sid="142"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con12" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Furthermore, in a validation study of 274 elderly participants from our cohort, sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaire measures with depression diagnosed based on structured psychiatric interview as the criterion are high, almost 90% for CES-D depressive symptoms and approximately 80% for GHQ symptoms.</text></s>
<s sid="143"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con13" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Despite a high response to the survey (range 66% to 88%) at the successive data collection phases, loss to follow-up accumulated over the extended follow-up, as is inevitable in long-term prospective studies.</text></s>
<s sid="144"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con14" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, differences between the included and excluded participants were generally small.</text></s>
<s sid="145"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Our study is based on an occupational cohort, which, by its very nature, is healthier than the general population, so the range of vascular risk scores and the range of depressive symptom measurements are likely to be narrower.</text></s>
<s sid="146"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This being the case, the associations between the Framingham risk scores and depressive symptoms reported here could underestimate the strength of associations in the general population, although similar associations between manifest vascular disease and depressive symptoms in the present dataset and those from the general population suggest that our estimates are likely to be fairly accurate.</text></s>
<s sid="147"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Due to the relatively low numbers of depressive symptom cases in the present data, we cannot detect weak associations between vascular risk scores and later-life depressive symptoms.</text></s>
Clinical Implications
<s sid="148"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These results suggest that public health measures to improve vascular status will influence the incidence of later-life depression, primarily via reduced rates of manifest vascular disease.</text></s>
<s sid="149"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con19" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Our findings on diagnosed vascular disease support current clinical guidelines to screen patients with coronary heart disease or stroke for depressive symptoms.</text></s>
<s sid="150"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con20" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, although the stroke risk score was associated with depressive symptoms before the age of 65, we found little evidence to suggest that standard clinical information on preclinical vascular risk status would be helpful in the prediction of depressive symptoms after the age of 65 years.</text></s>
<s sid="151"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con21" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thus, extending screening of incident later-life depression to include those identified as having a high risk of developing vascular disease was not supported by this study.</text></s>
