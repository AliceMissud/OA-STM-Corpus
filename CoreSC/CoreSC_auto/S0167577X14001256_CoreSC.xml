Introduction
<s sid="10"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>It has been widely accepted that dislocations act as sinks for point defects and defect clusters.</text></s>
<s sid="11"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Especially, edge dislocations are controlled by irradiation defects due to the interstitial bias of the sink [1,2].</text></s>
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Edge dislocations have hydrostatic stress fields around their core; therefore, it absorbs the point defects easily.</text></s>
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>While, there are no hydrostatic stress fields around the cores of screw dislocations.</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Thus, it is presumed that a driving force for moving point defects to the core of a screw dislocation does not exist.</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Because of these differences in the stress fields around the cores, the sink strength for a point defect is thought to be weaker than that for an edge dislocation.</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, the mechanism for the screw dislocation acting as a sink for point defects can be found indirectly, e.g., it is known that the absorption of either interstitials or vacancies at a screw dislocation changes it to a helical dislocation having partial edge component [3,4].</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Therefore, the core of the screw dislocation is considered to form kinks or jogs with an edge component, which shows interstitial bias.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Such kinks or jogs would enhance the transformation from screw to helical dislocation.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Irradiation softening is caused by such increase in the edge component.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This increase results in a large degree of softening in bcc metals because the Peierls stress rapidly increases at low temperature [5,6].</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In this way, screw dislocations are considered to have a significant influence on the formation of defects during irradiation, and the resulting mechanical properties increases edge components as a result of solute-dislocation interactions.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj1" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Using conventional methods, it is difficult to analyze solute atoms trapped at the core of dislocations, and it is also difficult to clarify which solute atom is dominant in the solute-screw dislocation interactions.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj2" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In a recent study, we succeeded in clearly visualizing in three-dimension, the solute segregation to the extended edge dislocations and proved solute segregation to stacking faults and Shockley partial dislocations in a neutron irradiated modified 316 stainless steel by using three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP) [7].</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In this study, we apply the method to liner screw dislocations to discuss the solute-screw dislocation interaction under neutron irradiation.</text></s>
