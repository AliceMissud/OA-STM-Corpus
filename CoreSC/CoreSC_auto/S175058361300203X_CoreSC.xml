Discussion
<s sid="140"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con13" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Seismic modeling and observations show that the effects of the injected CO2 on the 4D seismic data from Ketzin are significant, both regarding seismic amplitudes and time delays.</text></s>
<s sid="141"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con14" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, reservoir heterogeneity and seismic resolution, as well as random and coherent seismic noise are negative factors to be considered in seismic monitoring.</text></s>
<s sid="142"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is likely that the simulated scenarios of 38°C and 34°C are representative in the vicinity of the injection well and in the remaining reservoir, respectively, in October 2009.</text></s>
<s sid="143"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res58" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This is based on a measured temperature of approximately 38°C at the injection well at the monitoring time, while at the well Ktzi200/2007 the temperature increased to only slightly above 34°C and at the well Ktzi202/2007 the temperature remained at 34°C during the injection period.</text></s>
<s sid="144"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Since most of the CO2 is concentrated around the injection well, the higher temperature value plays an important role in estimating the mass of CO2 from the seismic data.</text></s>
<s sid="145"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The integration of seismic modeling and multiphase fluid flow simulations generated synthetic difference seismograms (repeat-base) that demonstrate the main features of the real difference seismograms (repeat-base) (Ivanova et al., 2012) (Fig. 8).</text></s>
<s sid="146"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Taking into account the assumptions made constructing the model we consider the correlation between the synthetic and real seismic sections to be satisfactory.</text></s>
<s sid="147"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con19" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, the following points should be considered when evaluating the modeling results.</text></s>
<s sid="148"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con20" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Firstly, the constant 20% reservoir porosity (Förster et al., 2009) used for modeling of the temperature effects is probably an over-simplification since the reservoir is quite heterogeneous (Förster et al., 2006).</text></s>
<s sid="149"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con21" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Secondly, sound waves may have a frequency dependent propagation velocity (e.g. White, 1975; Müller et al., 2010) so that the higher the frequency the higher the speed.</text></s>
<s sid="150"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Although velocity dispersion is probably present in the Ketzin reservoir rocks, we do not consider it to be large enough that it could considerably affect the qualitative and quantitative interpretation of our time-lapse seismic data (Ivanova et al., 2012).</text></s>
Thirdly, Eq.
<s sid="151"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res59" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>(1) was derived using results of petrophysical experiments at 40°C.</text></s>
<s sid="152"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res60" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For brine saturated sandstone, the seismic velocity does not depend on temperatures in the range of 34-40°C (Mavko, 2005), resulting in that there are only minor differences for Vp at conditions near the critical point (Han et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="153"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res61" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Via the Gassmann equations (1951) this translates into a maximum difference in Vp of 9m/s for 50% CO2 saturation for the Ketzin site comparing the 40°C and 34°C scenarios.</text></s>
<s sid="154"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Therefore, the effect of temperature on the velocity CO2 at the Ketzin site can be disregarded.</text></s>
<s sid="155"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res62" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The volumetric estimations of the CO2 mass based on the Ketzin 4D seismic data (Fig. 9) shows that the impact of temperature is significant for the calculations due to its impact on CO2 density.</text></s>
<s sid="156"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Hence, temperature monitoring is an important component for quantitative seismic interpretations at Ketzin, and probably at other sites.</text></s>
<s sid="157"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res63" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Using the temperature measured at the injection well for the mass estimations gives the best result for the CO2 mass quantification (Fig. 9).</text></s>
<s sid="158"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res64" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It is completely within the bounds of the known injected CO2 mass at the beginning and end of 3D seismic repeat acquisition campaign and in very good agreement with the CO2 mass estimation based on in situ CO2 saturation PNG logging (Fig. 9).</text></s>
<s sid="159"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res65" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Nevertheless, the quantitative analysis contains considerable uncertainties as discussed above and in Ivanova et al. (2012).</text></s>
<s sid="160"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con25" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Future issues to be considered include expanding the temperature range (34-38°C in this study) to be investigated and the resulting effects on the seismic response, as well as the role of the reservoir heterogeneity.</text></s>
<s sid="161"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con26" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In addition, it would be important to investigate the impact of temperature on CO2 storage at other sites with favorable P-T conditions in the reservoir (Fig. 3).</text></s>
<s sid="162"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con27" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>A similar approach applied to studying the impact of pressure in the reservoir would be also important for CO2 monitoring using 3D time-lapse seismic methods.</text></s>
Conclusions
<s sid="163"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con28" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>By integrating seismic modeling and multiphase fluid flow simulations, we have estimated the impact of the reservoir temperature on the 4D seismic data from Ketzin.</text></s>
<s sid="164"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con29" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We studied two cases, one where the injection was performed at 34°C and the other at 38°C.</text></s>
<s sid="165"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con30" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Results from the multiphase fluid flow simulations show that the difference between the two cases is small for the CO2 migration.</text></s>
<s sid="166"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con31" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Likewise, the temperature does not affect significantly the seismic amplitude response, although the CO2 density is considerably lower for the higher temperature case.</text></s>
<s sid="167"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con32" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The difference in CO2 density between 34°C and 38°C decreases with decreasing pressure and, therefore, with increasing distance from the injection well.</text></s>
<s sid="168"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con33" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Therefore, the modeled time-lapse seismic differences for the two temperature scenarios is minor regarding the qualitative analysis of the 4D seismic data from the Ketzin CO2 storage site (Fig. 8).</text></s>
<s sid="169"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con34" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, the volumetric estimation of the CO2 based on the 4D seismic data from Ketzin using results from the multiphase fluid flow simulations (Fig. 9) shows that the impact of temperature in the reservoir at the monitoring time is significant for these estimations.</text></s>
<s sid="170"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con35" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This is mostly due to its impact on CO2 density, which strongly depends on temperature.</text></s>
<s sid="171"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con36" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In addition to temperature effects, the simulated CO2 saturation levels also influence volumetric estimation.</text></s>
<s sid="172"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con37" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Our results show that temperature monitoring is very important for quantitative seismic interpretation at the Ketzin site.</text></s>
<s sid="173"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con38" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Using the higher temperature scenario, corresponding to that measured at the injection well, gives the best result for the CO2 mass quantification.</text></s>
