Introduction
<s sid="11"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) are a class of multifunctional material which demonstrate both electrical conductivity and optical transparency over visible light wavelengths.</text></s>
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This is made possible due to their intrinsic semiconducting nature and wide bandgap (&gt;3.2eV) respectively [1,2].</text></s>
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res4" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The coincidence of two highly useful physical properties means that such materials find use in diverse roles such as flat panel displays and solar cell applications [2-4].</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Tin oxide (SnO2) based TCOs are increasingly used due to their impressive TCO properties and their relative inexpense as compared to the traditional alternative; Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) [5].</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The high performance properties are due to the ability to dope the SnO2 framework, enhancing the intrinsic n-type semiconducting properties by an order of magnitude or more [1].</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The best SnO2 dopant to date has been fluorine (FTO).</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It introduces an extra charge carrier into the system per dopant ion; its effectiveness attributed to the ease with which it substitutes for oxygen within the SnO2 framework.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Doping with fluorine also introduces donor levels localised to the conduction band, so improving the n-type electrical properties [1,3].</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Since the integrity of the bandgap is largely preserved, optical transparency properties are also maintained which allows the concurrence of two normally conflicting physical phenomena.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Aerosol-assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition (AACVD) is a widely used thin film preparation.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The technique involves the transport of precursors within a vapourised solvent over a heated substrate, whereby the precursors effect thin film formation [6-8].</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Doped-SnO2 formation in AACVD requires the presence of tin, oxygen and dopant sources, delivered either together within the same solution or from separate solutions.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It has been found that the choice of precursor components and reactions prior to deposition have a marked effect on the resultant TCO properties [9].</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj2" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>FTO and other doped-SnO2 materials have also been deposited using atmospheric-pressure CVD (APCVD), spray pyrolysis, sol-gel dip coating and sputtering [5,10-12].</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The aim of this paper is thus to investigate the effects of halide dopants on the TCO properties of SnO2.</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Furthermore, the effects of these dopants on the general precursor chemistry will also be investigated.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The results reinforce the position of fluorine as the best dopant and yield insight into the interaction between precursor components prior to thin film deposition; namely that of a halide exchange reaction.</text></s>

<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The sole anomalous peak found at 31° is attributed to the persistent kinetic SnO(101) phase of tin oxide which seemed to increase in intensity with halide size, indicating a greater presence of mixed tin oxide phases.</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This implies that the halide dopants act as a kinetic obstruction to the formation of SnO2; the effects amplified with increasing halide size.</text></s>

Conclusions
<s sid="124"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con14" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We have elucidated an important reaction step in the formation of halide-doped SnO2 TCOs, namely a highly selective halide exchange process which takes place even in the most unfavourable of reaction conditions.</text></s>
<s sid="125"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The resultant substituted tin-dopant precursor complex is thought to be an important marker in the formation of high-performing SnO2-based TCOs.</text></s>
<s sid="126"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We have also demonstrated that high-performing TCOs can be obtained from doping SnO2 with halide dopants using AACVD.</text></s>
<s sid="127"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The results reinforce the position of fluorine as the best halide dopant yielding the highest performing polycrystalline SnO2-TCOs of small crystallite dimensions, with carrier mobilities of 15cm3/V.s, carrier concentrations of 8.85×1020cm-3 and optical transmittance of 80% over visible light wavelengths.</text></s>
<s sid="128"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These FTO thin films compare well with current commercial standards and can potentially be produced more safely and at lower cost.</text></s>
