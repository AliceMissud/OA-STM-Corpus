Introduction
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>A key challenge to understanding the effects of neurodegeneration is to characterise the changing patterns of brain network connectivity, in response to both the disease and its treatment (Pievani et al., 2011; Seeley et al., 2009; Warren et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The network paradigm of disease has many advantages, with the potential to elucidate selective vulnerability to a given neuropathology, explains the consequences of disease at a macroscopic level, and increases sensitivity of tools such as brain imaging that captures both integrative and segregated brain functions (Bassett and Bullmore, 2009; Mesulam, 1990).</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Many studies examine macroscopic networks using task-free 'resting state' paradigms, in which coactivation of distributed regions, or coherence among spontaneous neural oscillators, is thought to reflect functional networks (Corbetta, 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In response to task demands or experimental conditions, these networks are rapidly reconfigured to create a dynamic neuronal workspace for cognitive processing (Kitzbichler et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Neurodegenerative syndromes commonly disrupt such large scale networks (Rowe, 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For example, reductions in resting state connectivity mirror disease related changes in anatomical structure and connectivity with Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementias and Parkinsonian syndromes (Greicius, 2008; Greicius et al., 2004; Seeley et al., 2009; Whitwell et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Task based network configuration can also be changed by focal degeneration and atrophy (Sonty et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, neurodegeneration not only weakens specific network connections, but can also lead to reorganisation of the networks by enhancing connectivity among the relatively unaffected regions (Seeley et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Moreover, recent studies have emphasized the concordance between reductions in network connectivity during resting state and the distinctive focal atrophy patterns in neurodegenerative dementias (Seeley et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2010) or changes in white matter tracts supporting those networks (Raj et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Different clinical syndromes can result in specific changes to brain networks, but there may also be generic reorganisation in response to degeneration associated with diverse pathologies.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>In this study, we examined two distinct neurodegenerative diseases and asked whether disease specific neurodegeneration is related to particular network changes, or whether there is a 'transdiagnostic' network-level response affecting the macroscopic network dynamics.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>We examined behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP); two rapidly progressive neurodegenerative diseases that have key differences in clinical phenotypes.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>bvFTD is characterised by changes in behaviour, cognition and personality (Rascovsky et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In contrast, PSP is defined by a vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, akinetic rigidity and falls (Litvan et al., 2003; Richardson et al., 1963), with typically milder cognitive impairment including apathy.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The two syndromes have distinct and overlapping macroscopic anatomy of tissue loss.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>bvFTD is associated with marked atrophy of prefrontal cortex (orbital, ventral and/or medial), anterior insula, anterior cingulate and anterior temporal lobes including cortex and the amygdala (Schroeter et al., 2007, 2008; Seelaar et al., 2011; Seeley, 2010; Seeley et al., 2009), although other atrophy patterns with temporoparietal atrophy have been reported (Whitwell et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In PSP atrophy is severe in the upper brain stem and superior cerebellar peduncle, with moderate atrophy of medial prefrontal cortex, insula/frontal operculum, cingulate cortex, precentral gyrus and superior parietal lobule (Brenneis et al., 2004; Chiu et al., 2012; Ghosh et al., 2012; Nicoletti et al., 2008).</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met1" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>To compare the impact of bvFTD and PSP on macroscopic functional brain networks, we used an auditory oddball paradigm, providing a physiological measure of automatic change detection.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Such paradigms include a stream of 'standard' stimuli, interspersed with 'deviant' stimuli (e.g. differing from the standard by pitch or duration).</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res4" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This unpredictable change elicits a robust electrophysiological mismatch negativity signal (MMN, or MMNm in the context of MEG studies), detectable by electro- or magneto-encephalography in auditory cortex between 100ms and 200ms after the onset of the deviant tone.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This signal has been proposed as a marker of psychiatric and degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia (Naatanen et al., 2011, 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Moreover, from a basic science perspective, change detection is an important element of higher order cognitive functions, such as attention and memory (cf.</text></s>
Naatanen et al., 2007).
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In addition to the auditory cortex, other brain regions contribute to the generation of the MMN response.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac19" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These include prefrontal cortex (Boly et al., 2011; Doeller et al., 2003; Liasis et al., 2001; Rosburg et al., 2005; Schall et al., 2003), which is necessary for early change detection through frontal to temporal feedback connections (Alain et al., 1998; Alho et al., 1994; Garrido et al., 2009a).</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac20" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Parietal cortex is also associated with the MMN, in both electrophysiological (Hsiao et al., 2010; Marco-Pallares et al., 2005) and fMRI studies (Molholm et al., 2005).</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac21" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>To measure the network connectivity among these frontal, temporal and parietal cortical sources, we adopted dynamic causal modelling for magnetoencephalography data.</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac22" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Magnetoencephalography is sensitive to the spatiotemporal effects of bvFTD during cognitive tasks (Hughes et al., 2011), proportional to clinical deficits, and well tolerated by patients as a functional brain imaging modality.</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac23" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Dynamic causal modelling has several advantages over other methods to test our hypotheses, including (1) empirical priors that introduce biophysical constraints on the network models; (2) the use of generative (predictive) models that can be tested against the observed data, and evaluated and compared using objective measures of the model evidences; and (3) embodying different hypotheses about the impact of disease on network structures and connectivity in explicit and directional spatiotemporal network models.</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac24" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Dynamic causal modelling also incorporates the modulatory effects of experimental manipulations on connections, such as the difference between standard and deviant stimuli, providing evidence of the critical connections for change detection (Kiebel et al., 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj8" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>We used dynamic causal modelling to measure network connectivity underlying the detection of change.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj9" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>We included different families of network models to test two principal hypotheses.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp1" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>First, we predicted that the network recruited in health for change detection would be altered by disease.</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp2" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>Specifically, since bvFTD and PSP have prefrontal neuropathology, we predicted that network reorganisation would lead to more distributed networks with enhanced connectivity among the less affected parietal regions.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Secondly, we predicted that disease would also affect the modulation of the network by the experimental context (i.e. the difference between the standard and deviant tones).</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Thus, we not only predict that patients will have a change in network architecture, but also a change in the dynamic modulation of connectivity from trial to trial.</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A corollary of this network change is reduced automatic detection of unpredictable change, and therefore a reduction in amplitudes and delayed latency of the MMNm response in the auditory cortex.</text></s>

<s sid="211"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa4" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The model set was sufficient for our principal hypotheses and allowed us to examine cortico-cortical network changes related to the change detection paradigm.</text></s>

Conclusion
<s sid="216"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con37" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We have shown that two neurodegenerative syndromes, bvFTD and PSP, cause a similar change in the organisation of large-scale functional brain networks.</text></s>
<s sid="217"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con38" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The sparse intrahemispheric network with modulation of frontal-temporal connectivity was replaced by a widely distributed network with interhemispheric connectivity, and modulation of frontal-parietal and temporal-parietal connections.</text></s>
<s sid="218"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res59" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These network changes were accompanied by reduced amplitudes and delayed latencies of the MMNm.</text></s>
<s sid="219"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con39" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The similarity of the response of the neural networks to two clinically distinct disorders may reflect commonalities in their neuropathology, and is likely to be a response to focal degeneration in prefrontal cortex.</text></s>
<s sid="220"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con40" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This response includes recruitment to the network and more extensive, albeit inefficient, contextual modulation of connectivity.</text></s>
<s sid="221"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con41" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Given the importance of change detection to many higher cognitive functions, including learning and goal-directed behaviours, dysregulation of its underlying network may contribute to the higher order cognitive deficits observed in bvFTD and PSP.</text></s>
<s sid="222"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con42" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, before these methods can be adopted as biomarkers for dementias, further work will be required to show the temporal evolution of plexopathy, and the extent to which it can be reversed by candidate therapies.</text></s>
