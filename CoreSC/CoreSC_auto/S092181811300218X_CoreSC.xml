Introduction
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For stratigraphy of the Cenozoic Era, the Mediterranean is of peculiar meaning because nearly all stages are defined with their GSSPs in this region.</text></s>
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These GSSPs were established in deep water successions, many of them in Italy, which have a complete record and planktonic fossils afford the necessary biostratigraphic resolution (Hilgen et al., 2012; Vandenberghe et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>More recently, this time resolution was distinctly enhanced by astrochronology, which allows to resolve at a scale of thousands of years (e.g., Shackleton et al., 2000; Hilgen et al., 2003; Iaccarino et al., 2004, 2011; Hilgen, 2008; Turco et al., 2011a).</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Due to this high time resolution and more stable environmental conditions paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic interpretations for the Cenozoic mainly rest on isotope studies of deep water deposits (e.g., Miller et al., 1991; Zachos et al., 2001; Billups and Schrag, 2003; Holbourn et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In contrast to deep water successions, there is an intrinsic limitation regarding achievable age resolution of shallow water deposits (Mutti et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Hence, Cenozoic shallow-marine sedimentary successions in the Mediterranean region are predominantly lithostratigraphically classified.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Accurate chronostratigraphic correlations are generally impeded by the stratigraphically incomplete record and the less precise biostratigraphic resolution in shallow and marginal marine settings (Mutti et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Accordingly, the stratigraphic distribution of specific heterozoan and chlorozoan carbonate facies associations in the central Mediterranean and their relationship to the Neogene climate trends and particular paleoceanographic conditions in the Mediterranean Sea mainly rely on δ13C records (Jacobs et al., 1996; Mutti et al., 1997, 1999, 2006; John et al., 2003; Kocsis et al., 2008; Brandano et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, a comparison between sections evidences specific regional offsets and, generally, an offset with the global carbon isotope record (Mutti et al., 1997, 1999; Brandano et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Two main factors may explain these discrepancies between the Mediterranean shallow-marine and the global deep-sea isotope curves: (1) an inadequate or low resolution stratigraphy; or (2) the specific paleogeographic and paleoceanographic changes, which occur in this region during the Oligocene-Miocene (Pedley, 1987; Brandano and Corda, 2002; Bosellini and Perrin, 2008; Brandano et al., 2009a,b, 2010).</text></s>

<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Due to its isolated position (Mutti et al., 1999; Brandano et al., 2012) and long-term stratigraphic record of shallow water sediments (Vecsei and Sanders, 1997) this carbonate platform is well suited to identify local processes possibly overprinting regional or global signals in neritic carbonates.</text></s>
