Introduction
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Natural variations in carbon isotope composition (δ13C) provide a powerful tool for studying C dynamics in the soil-plant-atmosphere system (Hanson et al., 2000; Ehleringer et al., 2000; Bowling et al., 2008), including partitioning of the autotrophic and heterotrophic components of the surface flux, RS.</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Reliably estimating the heterotrophic component of RS is crucial for the characterisation of an ecosystem's net C balance.</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot2" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>The difference between the C fluxes arising from soil heterotrophic respiration and net primary production defines an ecosystem's net exchange of C, which determines if the system is a net source of, or sink for, atmospheric CO2.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot3" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>It is therefore crucial to estimate the contributions of individual components of RS, e.g., CO2 derived from autotrophic root respiration or from heterotrophic respiration of microbes decomposing recent litter, or old soil organic matter (SOM).</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj2" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Normally, three-way partitioning can be achieved only using two isotopes.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Here we report a new approach that combines δ13C measurements of CO2 derived from SOM, roots and litter with the corresponding mass-dependent CO2 fluxes to estimate their relative and absolute contributions to RS.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Generally, chemical and biochemical processes accumulate the lighter isotope in the product, leaving the substrate enriched in the heavier isotope (Högberg and Ekblad, 1996).</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This fractionation can differ among biological processes.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Recently, Werth and Kuzyakov (2010) reviewed 13C/12C fractionations by biotic processes occurring at the root-microbe-soil interface.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res2" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>They reported that organic C in the root tissues of C3 vegetation are generally 13C-enriched by 1.2 ± 0.6‰ compared with the aboveground tissues, whereas the CO2 respired by roots is depleted by 2.1 ± 2.6‰, compared with root organic C.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Under C3 vegetation, microbial CO2 is enriched by 0.7 ± 2.8‰ in comparison to the C in SOM.</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res4" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The causes of δ13C variation in respired CO2 can be summarised as: (i) isotopic effects during the metabolic synthesis of secondary compounds (e.g., lipids, lignin, cellulose); (ii) variation in photosynthetic discrimination against 13C combined with temporal lags in the movement of photosynthates through plant and soil pools; (iii) shifts in microbial δ13C due to anaplerotic CO2 fixation; (iv) preferential use of certain respiratory substrates by microbes; and (v) kinetic fractionation of 13C/12C during microbial respiration (Tu and Dawson, 2005; Bowling et al., 2008).</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Most of the C in SOM derives from the microbial degradation of plant litter which consists of polysaccharides and more depleted lignin 13C.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Since easily decomposable substances like glucose or sucrose are preferentially decomposed by microbes, the balance between litter-derived compounds retained in the soil has a direct impact, via isotopic mass balance, on the net δ13C of SOM (Cotrufo et al., 2005).</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, the δ13C of SOM in forest ecosystems generally increases (i.e., becomes more negative) with soil depth by approximately 1-3‰ relative to that of the litter layer (Nadelhoffer and Fry, 1988).</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The reasons for this are still unclear (Boström et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Possible explanations include the accumulated influence of isotopic discrimination during selective microbial decomposition of specific substrates within the SOM (Nadelhoffer and Fry, 1988; Buchmann et al., 1997; Lin et al., 1999), and more importantly by the increased contribution of microbially derived C to SOM with depth (Ehleringer et al., 2000; Högberg et al., 2005).</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met10" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The use of δ13C for partitioning the contribution of different sources of RS has the advantage of permitting in situ measurements with minimal disturbance to soil and roots (Hanson et al., 2000; Paterson et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met11" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Its success relies on distinguishing small differences in δ13C of CO2 produced by autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration, and it is frequently applied in combination with incubation of excised roots, litter, and SOM samples.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Studies of variations in δ13C of RS commonly use mass balance equations to estimate the proportions of two (and rarely more than two) C sources that contribute to the soil surface CO2 flux (Lin et al., 1999; Ngao et al., 2005; Sakata et al., 2007; Millard et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod2" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Isotopic linear mixing models partition the contributions of n + 1 sources, when n isotopically distinct tracers (e.g., δ13C, δ15N, δ18O) are used as end-members, and assume that source signatures that fall closest to that of the mixture provide the greatest contribution.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod3" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Factors such as the seasonal variability of the photosynthetic discrimination, as well as environmental conditions such as soil temperature and soil moisture, can vary the differences in δ13C between CO2 derived from different C pools, and are therefore important constraints on the partitioning method (Phillips and Gregg, 2001; Trumbore, 2006).</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod4" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The isotopic approach also needs to overcome uncertainties associated with the binary diffusion of 12CO2 and 13CO2 through the soil's gas-filled pore space and across the soil-air interface.</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Generally, the slower molecular diffusivity of 13CO2 can induce CO2 in bulk soil to be up to 4.4‰ more enriched in 13C than that released at the soil surface δ13CRs (Amundson et al., 1998; Cerling et al., 1991).</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Some complications in the interpretation of diffusive flux profiles were discussed by Koehler et al. (2010).</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Transient conditions in diffusive flux profiles can be caused by time-varying respiratory CO2 production (Moyes et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In addition, changes in atmospheric pressure and wind effects (advection) can alter the diffusion of soil CO2 (Dudziak and Halas, 1996), From a diffusion experiment involving artificial soil and CO2 source, Kayler et al. (2008) concluded that non-steady-state effects must be considered in field investigations of δ13CRs in soils.</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, the correct interpretation of δ13CRs data is likely determined by the possibility of using measuring techniques which avoid perturbation of the steady-state diffusion conditions of respiration.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Soil surface chambers are the most commonly used technique to measure δ13CRs.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Such approaches include: (i) purging of atmospheric δ13C-CO2 in the chamber headspace (Flanagan et al., 1996; Buchmann and Ehleringer, 1998), (ii) long-term chamber deployment for δ13CRs equilibration (Mora and Raich, 2007), and (iii) the maintenance of chamber headspace at atmospheric CO2 concentration, [CO2] (Subke et al., 2004a; Bertolini et al., 2006; Midwood et al., 2008).</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, several decades of experience with chamber-based measurements have revealed numerous potential sources of errors in measuring soil respiration (Davidson et al., 2002).</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac19" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Some recent studies on the use of closed- and open-chamber systems reported evidence of perturbation of the δ13C steady-state diffusion profile and 12CO2 and 13CO2 gradients (Ohlsson et al., 2005; Nickerson and Risk, 2009; Gamnitzer et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac20" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In addition, the installation of soil collars several centimetres into the soil, to minimize CO2 leakage in and out of the chamber (Hutchinson and Livingston, 2001), has raised concerns regarding the possibility of measuring δ13CRs beyond the collar insertion depth (Kayler et al., 2008), and their utility in soil respiration partitioning studies (Heinemeyer et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>To address these concerns, we developed and used a dual-chamber technique to minimize the artefacts and biases in chamber-based measurements of δ13CRs.</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>In addition, we aimed to partition the soil surface CO2 flux into its components derived from root, litter/humus, and SOM sources and, alternatively, into autotrophic and heterotrophic components.</text></s>
Materials and methods
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac21" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Background and principles of the dual-chamber development</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac22" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In general, to correctly measure δ13CRs it is essential to maintain unbiased the diffusion conditions of RS at soil surface.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac23" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The reason for this assumption is as follows.</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The mass of 13C is larger than that of 12C and diffuses through the soil at a slower rate leading to a theoretical kinetic fractionation of 13C and 12C.</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met12" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This means that for estimates of δ13CRs obtained using gas samples withdrawn from the soil profile, a correction of up to 4.4‰ is necessary to account for this fractionation (Amundson et al., 1998).</text></s>
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met13" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Although transient changes in soil diffusivity and CO2 concentration gradient might constantly alter the relative diffusion rates of 12CO2 and 13CO2 isotopologues, Cerling et al. (1991) demonstrated that if soil respiration is at a diffusive steady-state, the δ13C of soil surface flux should theoretically match the δ13C produced within the soil.</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met14" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Thus the measurements made at the soil surface do not need to be corrected for fractionation due to diffusion.</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met15" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This assumption means that a chamber technique used for δ13CRs measurements has to achieve and maintain over few hours after its deployment the equilibrium between the soil CO2 efflux and the RS captured inside the chamber headspace.</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met16" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Depending on the type of soil surface chamber used, RS measurements are generally subject to disturbances which can have a large impact on the certainty of δ13CRs estimates and on subsequent source partitioning.</text></s>
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac24" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Some artefacts and biases in steady-state and non-steady-state respiration chambers measurements were discussed by Davidson et al. (2002).</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac25" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For steady-state chambers, these can be summarized as: (i) lateral and vertical diffusion of CO2 produced below the chamber base due to the alteration of the diffusion gradient (Hutchinson and Livingston, 2001; Davidson et al., 2002; Nickerson and Risk, 2009); (ii) the risk of pressure differentials between the headspace volume and the surrounding atmosphere due to the improper control of gas flow rates (Hutchinson et al., 2000); (iii) over-pressurization of the headspace volume when pressurized CO2-free air is forced through to control the CO2 concentration inside the chambers (Lund et al., 1999); (iv) the exchange of gas through the vent in over-pressurized conditions which can dilute chamber air with ambient air (Longdoz et al., 2000); and (v) the alteration of concentration gradients at the soil surface due to excessive turbulence caused by fans inside the chambers used for air circulation (Le Dantec et al., 1999).</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In general, it is difficult to make a clear distinction between the effects of chamber measurements and the transient changes of biological activities and gas transport on δ13CRs.</text></s>
<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Nickerson and Risk (2009) predicted under lateral diffusion scenarios an error of estimation ranging around 4‰ for steady-state chambers, with a maximum of 15‰ for non-steady-state respiration.</text></s>
<s sid="63"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac26" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, the magnitude of the disturbance created by chambers depends on the soil CO2 production rate, and can vary with soil moisture conditions (Phillips et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="64"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met17" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>For many surface chamber techniques, δ13CO2 measurements from dry soils are more biased towards enriched values than δ13CO2 measurements from wet soils.</text></s>
<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met18" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In order to reduce the above artefacts we modified the steady-state chamber by introducing inside the headspace a horizontal CO2-permeable membrane to create a dual-chamber with two physically separate volumes.</text></s>
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The top-chamber (Ct; Fig. 1) has the characteristics and functions of a conventional steady-state chamber.</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs3" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The CO2-permeable membrane effectively establishes a 'virtual' soil surface that mimics conditions at the real surface.</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In the bottom-chamber (Cb), CO2 accumulates in response to a concentration gradient that matches that in undisturbed soil, so minimising many of the artefacts listed above.</text></s>
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs4" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>This is achieved by continually adjusting the CO2 concentration in Ct to the CO2 concentration measured in a nearby open-topped reference chamber (Cr).</text></s>
<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs5" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>When the CO2 concentrations in Ct and Cr are matched, CO2 can be sampled from the bottom-chamber, Cb, for δ13C determination.</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This system also eliminates the use of soil collars, permitting quicker equilibration of CO2 concentration for the δ13CRs measurements, and minimal severing of soil surface roots and hyphae.</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac27" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Depending on the ecosystem type, the season, the time of the day, and the measuring technique used, the CO2 concentrations within a few centimetres of the soil surface are elevated above ambient atmospheric values reaching concentrations up to 10 times higher that in the atmosphere (Risk et al., 2002; Davidson et al., 2006; DeSutter et al., 2008; Albanito et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp1" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>For this reason, when a background ambient concentration is used in both steady-state and non-steady-state chambers, the vertical gradient of CO2 concentration at soil surface must be carefully considered in order to avoid the alteration of the soil profile CO2 diffusion gradient (Davidson et al., 2002).</text></s>

Discussion
<s sid="209"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met26" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This study has provided new information about the contributions of belowground components to the CO2 flux at the soil surface, RS, and has shown an alternative approach to partition RS components using their 13C signatures.</text></s>
<s sid="210"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met27" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This was possible because of the development of the novel dual-chamber technique to ensure that δ13CRs was subjected to minimal artefacts during measurement, and the combination of δ13C and CO2 flux data to achieve a three-way partitioning of the soil surface flux, RS.</text></s>
Partitioning of RS
<s sid="211"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res56" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>CO2 emitted at the soil surface is derived from the microbial breakdown of various organic materials: root carbohydrates and exudates (both of which are derivatives of recent photosynthate), microbial biomass, mycorrhizal fungi, fresh litter, dead roots and SOM.</text></s>
<s sid="212"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con8" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These materials have different chemical compositions, different decomposabilities and, therefore, make variable contributions to the total soil-derived CO2 flux.</text></s>
<s sid="213"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con9" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Separating these distinct heterotrophic components is necessary for assessing how environmental changes may alter the carbon balance in belowground ecosystems.</text></s>
<s sid="214"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con10" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>As explained in the Introduction, it is the flux from SOM, usually the oldest and most durable C belowground C store that, with NPP, determines an ecosystem's net C balance.</text></s>
<s sid="215"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con11" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>For that reason, it is important to distinguish the SOM-derived flux from the others.</text></s>
<s sid="216"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res57" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>When RS was partitioned in two ways at San Rossore, the mean autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration was 56 and 44% of RS, respectively.</text></s>
<s sid="217"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res58" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These results are similar to most reported values in temperate forests (Kelting et al., 1998; Hanson et al., 2000).</text></s>
<s sid="218"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res59" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>By contrast, when RS was partitioned three ways, roots, litter/humus, and SOM contributed 30, 33, and 37% of the total flux, respectively, which are similar to other studies in forest which partition RS among root, litter, and SOM (Tedeschi et al., 2006; Lin et al., 1999).</text></s>
<s sid="219"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res60" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, the mean heterotrophic flux obtained with the three- way partition was higher than those obtained from the two-way partition, 0.15 and 0.23 g CO2 m-2 h-1, respectively.</text></s>
<s sid="220"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res61" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This means that during the spring, the litter and humus collectively represent the major component of RS in San Rossore.</text></s>
<s sid="221"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res62" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Moreover RL had the highest variability among the three C pools, while RSOM was fairly constant throughout the study period (Table 3).</text></s>
<s sid="222"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con12" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This may be explained by the mycorrhizal hyphal respiration which, being particularly sensitive to changes of soil surface moisture (Heinemeyer et al., 2007), could have contributed to increasing the variability of RL.</text></s>
<s sid="223"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con13" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Researchers must always consider the uncertainty inherent in isotope measurements due to artefacts, spatial heterogeneity in the soil diffusive environment, possible advective processes which can cause transient changes in relative soil diffusion rates of 12CO2 and 13CO2 isotopologues, and time-varying 13C signals of different soil carbon pool.</text></s>
<s sid="224"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res63" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We discuss here some of the uncertainties associated with the partitioning of RS obtained using our method.</text></s>
<s sid="225"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res64" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>First, the litter/humus layer is characterized by a dense proliferation of fine roots, mycorrhizal roots and extra-radical mycelium characterized by 13C discrimination in respired CO2 very similar to that of autotrophic respiration.</text></s>
<s sid="226"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res65" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The similarity between δ13CR and δ13CL represents a limiting factor for the partitioning power of the three end-member mixing model.</text></s>
<s sid="227"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res66" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In San Rossore, depending on the time of day, δ13CR and δ13CL were separated by 2-3‰.</text></s>
<s sid="228"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res67" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, CO2 emitted at the soil surface is a mixture of sources which depends not only on the sources involved, but also on the depth at which CO2 is produced from them and from which it is transported to the surface (Maseyk et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="229"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con14" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Hence, to correctly partition RS we need to understand the contribution of the depth-related enrichment of soil δ13C-CO2 to surface measurements of δ13CRs.</text></s>
<s sid="230"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In that respect, the three end-member mixing model here reported takes into account the discriminations during CO2 respiration/decomposition of three bulk soil C pools, as well as the fractions of their CO2 flux integrated over their total mass.</text></s>
<s sid="231"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The approximation of the litter/humus layer as a discrete component permitted a more accurate estimation of the flux from the most durable forms of C stored belowground.</text></s>
<s sid="232"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res68" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Although further investigation is still required to identify the applicability of the model in different mineral and organic soils, the promising results obtained in the mineral soil of San Rossore were also obtained in a loamy skeleton podsol-brown earth soil of a spruce stand in Germany (data not shown).</text></s>
<s sid="233"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs14" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>However, in that case the model required an increase of the sampling depth to 40 cm, and the removal of the stone weight from the calculation of the mass-specific rate of CO2 production of the three end-members.</text></s>
<s sid="234"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res69" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>By contrast, in the two-way partitioning, the respiration from the contribution of the litter/humus layer was divided between the autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration.</text></s>
<s sid="235"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>When using that method, the soil depth from which the heterotrophic end-member is collected can usually be chosen arbitrarily assuming that unmeasured components or tracers have the same concentrations or do not contribute significantly to RS and δ13CRs.</text></s>
<s sid="236"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This means that the estimation from the two-way partition could result in higher uncertainties due to a possible over- or under-estimation of the heterotrophic component.</text></s>
<s sid="237"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con19" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Measuring δ13CR at the soil surface</text></s>
<s sid="238"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con20" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Since Cerling et al. (1991) demonstrated that if soil respiration is at a diffusive steady-state, the δ13C of the soil surface flux should theoretically match the δ13C produced within the soil, much effort has been put into measuring the δ13C of soil surface CO2.</text></s>
<s sid="239"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac28" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>To date, several studies have been published using chamber techniques to measure δ13CRs (Subke et al., 2004a; Ohlsson et al., 2005; Bertolini et al., 2006; Mora and Raich, 2007; Midwood et al., 2008).</text></s>
<s sid="240"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con21" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, due to the conflicting results regarding the capability of the closed and open-chamber methods to provide unbiased measurements of δ13CRs, a degree of uncertainty still remains in the use of these techniques (Nickerson and Risk, 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="241"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac29" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Approximately a decade ago, Davidson et al. (2002), summarizing a few decades of experience with chamber-based measurements, discussed several concerns about uncertainties associated with chamber-based measurements of CO2 emissions from soils.</text></s>
<s sid="242"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj4" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Later, these concerns were reviewed by Nickerson and Risk (2009) who, for the first time, investigated the importance of the artefacts and biases of chamber-based measurements in δ13Cefflux estimates.</text></s>
<s sid="243"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is beyond the scope of this study to challenge the use of common techniques such as steady-state and non-steady-state for δ13Ceffux measurement, but our approach attempted to circumvent some of the major reported limitations of chamber-based measurements of δ13Cefflux.</text></s>
<s sid="244"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The dual-chamber technique represents a novel approach for improving field measurements of δ13CRs.</text></s>
<s sid="245"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Our results clearly demonstrate the ability of this technique to adequately measure δ13Ceffux, and it provides the possibility to ensure that conditions better approximate those that are ideally required for the accurate and unbiased measurement of soil surface respiration and δ13CRs.</text></s>
<s sid="246"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con25" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Several features of our approach make this possible.</text></s>
<s sid="247"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con26" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>First, there is the possibility to maintain separate, within the dual-chamber volume, the top steady-state chamber headspace from the bottom-chamber volume where the δ13CORs is measured.</text></s>
<s sid="248"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con27" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This should minimize all the artefacts and biases occurring in the top steady-state chamber.</text></s>
<s sid="249"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con28" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In the top-chamber mass flow induced by pressure gradients and high air flow rates could result in isotopic fractionation of δ13CRs in the top-chamber.</text></s>
<s sid="250"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con29" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, the absence of fan, the presence of a vent, and the careful control of the flow rates in the top-chamber should be sufficient minimize the effects of advective gas transport across the membrane.</text></s>
<s sid="251"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con30" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Whereas, the maintenance for few hours of sustained bulk flow in the top-chamber should stabilize the transport of 13CO2 and 12CO2 at the same rate across the PVDF membrane (Amundson et al., 1998).</text></s>
<s sid="252"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con31" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In addition, the absence of bulk airflow in the bottom-chamber (calm conditions), should guarantee a gas movement exclusively by free air molecular diffusion along gradient of mole fraction, which maintained for few hours should be sufficient to reduce the differences between the measured δ13CRs and the soil δ13Cefflux (Bowling and Massman, 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="253"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con32" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Arguably, the circulation of air in the bottom-chamber through the closed sampling loop, and the CRDS, could be subjected to a possible pump leakage.</text></s>
<s sid="254"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp65" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>Here the sampling loop was operated by the CRDS internal pump with at a flow rate of approximately 22 ml min-1.</text></s>
<s sid="255"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp66" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>Considering the volume of the bottom-chamber (≈1718 cm3), and the duration of the δ13C measurements (sub-routine with a duration time of 30 min), the volume circulated by the CRDS was approximately two-fifths of the entire volume of the bottom-chamber.</text></s>
<s sid="256"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con33" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Therefore, any pump leakage was considered small enough to be ignored.</text></s>
<s sid="257"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con34" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Second, the use of reference diffusion chambers, in combination with the dual-chambers, allowed near soil surface CO2 concentrations to be measured.</text></s>
<s sid="258"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con35" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This allowed us to correctly set up the measuring conditions in the dual-chambers and to minimize the disturbance of the soil CO2 diffusion gradient during the dual-chamber deployment.</text></s>
<s sid="259"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con36" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>While the ideal methods to measure CO2 concentrations between the litter layer and a few centimetres above the soil surface are still to be developed, here we describe the first method which poses an alternative to the widespread use of an arbitrary near-constant CO2 concentration (ambient level) in chamber-based estimates of δ13CORs.</text></s>
<s sid="260"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con37" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Moreover, the dual-chamber technique permits the constant estimation of the CO2 diffusion coefficient (Dc) occurring between the two sides of the dual-chambers.</text></s>
<s sid="261"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con38" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Dc is a critical parameter to evaluate the diffusive conditions during the measurements of RS and δ13CORs.</text></s>
<s sid="262"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res70" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Considering that the transport coefficient for soil gas exchange typically ranges from 1 to 10 mm2 s-1 (Kimball, 1983), our results showed that Dc was 5.2 ± 1.8 mm2 s-1 (mean ± SD).</text></s>
<s sid="263"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res71" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This means that during our dual-chamber measurements Dc was always within the typical soil diffusivity range, and never reached values of CO2 diffusivity in free air (16.4 mm2 s-1).</text></s>
<s sid="264"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res72" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Third, using the measured soil surface CO2 concentrations as the baseline level for the dual-chamber operation, it was possible to achieve the necessary CO2 efflux steady-state conditions without using permanent collars inserted in the soil.</text></s>
<s sid="265"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res73" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In that respect, Heinemeyer et al. (2011) argued convincingly against the indiscriminate use of deep soil collars for successful CO2 efflux measurements.</text></s>
<s sid="266"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res74" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>They showed that in forests, chambers inserted on the shallowest collar were systematically unaffected by the mixing vortex of atmospheric CO2 in the upper soil profile.</text></s>
Conclusion
<s sid="267"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con39" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We conclude that the biological components contributing to RS at the forest site of San Rossore were mostly from heterotrophic origin, and constrained within the top 20-30 cm of the soil profile.</text></s>
<s sid="268"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con40" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Our results reflected the soil respiration processes which characterize a water- and nutrient-limited forest sites such as San Rossore (Rosenkranz et al., 2006).</text></s>
<s sid="269"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con41" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In a recent study on the soil organic carbon of six Mediterranean forest sites in Italy, Chiti et al. (2010) reported that the pine forest of San Rossore had the lowest SOC accumulation within the top 20 cm of soil profile, and predicted that by the end of the second commitment period of the Kyoto protocol (2013-2017) would become a source of SOC.</text></s>
<s sid="270"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con42" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Undoubtedly, the possibility of having the CO2 production constrained within the top 30 cm of the soil profile, as well as estimating δ13CRs on a highly porous sandy soil, represented a fundamental advantage for the application of the three end-member model in this study.</text></s>
<s sid="271"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res75" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In a porous soil, the gradients in CO2 concentration and 13CO2 abundance adjust very quickly across depth.</text></s>
<s sid="272"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res76" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Thus, the soil CO2 and δ13C profiles reflect the depth-integrated CO2 sources (biotic processes) rather than the local fluctuations in production rates due to transient changes in CO2 diffusivity (abiotic processes) (Maseyk et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="273"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con43" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Nevertheless, the results of this study demonstrate the importance of partitioning soil efflux considering both the 13C discrimination of respiratory components and their mass-specific rate of CO2 production.</text></s>
<s sid="274"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con44" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Finally, the dual-chambers used in this study have the advantage of being inexpensive to construct and, once constructed, are robust and require little routine maintenance.</text></s>
