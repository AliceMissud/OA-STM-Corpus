Introduction
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Enceladus, one out of currently 62 satellites of Saturn, orbits the planet at a distance of 3.95 Saturn radii RS (1RS=60,268km) and is embedded in the radiation belts of Saturn's inner magnetosphere.</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Even with a small radius REnc of only 252km and an apparent similarity to other icy moons, this moon is by far the most important internal source of dust, neutral gas and plasma in the saturnian system and especially in the magnetosphere.</text></s>

<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>While the macrosignatures are seen at all local times and latitudes the microsignatures are highly dependent on the longitudinal distance between the observer (spacecraft) and the absorbing body (for a mathematical description see van Allen et al.

<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In addition to the bounce motion up and down along the field lines the charged particles magnetically drift perpendicular to the B→×∇B→ direction.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Since both B→ and ∇B→ are disturbed around Enceladus, the electron motion will also be disturbed, modifying to some extent the flux distribution in the moon's vicinity.</text></s>

<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met8" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Particles are measured simultaneously from two opposite directions (low-energy telescope (LE) and high-energy telescope (HE)).</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met9" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Low-energy electrons and ions measured in LE are separated by a strong internal magnet.</text></s>

<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met11" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Data are recorded in rate channels.</text></s>
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs4" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The instrument is mounted on top of a movable turntable which rotates about the -y-axis of the spacecraft within 86s, nominally.</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs5" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The -y-axis points in the direction of the remote sensing instruments (often pointed towards the planet or another object).</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res22" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Under this configuration MIMI/LEMMS is therefore scanning in the x-z-plane of the spacecraft coordinate system allowing very good pitch angle coverage.</text></s>
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs6" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Unfortunately the turntable stopped rotating in the beginning of 2005 for unknown reasons after the release of the Huygens probe.</text></s>
<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs7" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Therefore during all the Enceladus encounters MIMI/LEMMS was not rotating anymore.</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res23" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Since then the low-energy telescope points at an angle of 77.45° away from the -z direction towards the -x-direction (see Fig. 1).</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met12" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The advantage of that non-rotating mode is the time resolution of the instrument which is 16 times better than in the rotating mode (5.65s) for the rate channels or 0.66s for the priority channels instead of 86s for a given pointing/pitch angle).</text></s>
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met13" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This enables us to measure small-scale, short-lived features in the data set.</text></s>

<s sid="76"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met16" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The angular resolution is restricted by the field-of-view of the instrument's apertures and look direction (limitation in measured pitch angle) of the MIMI/LEMMS sensors.</text></s>
<s sid="77"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod1" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>In the calculation of the pitch angle it is assumed that all particles enter through the central entrance of the instrument's apertures with opening angles of 15° and 30° for low-energy and high-energy end, respectively.</text></s>
<s sid="78"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod2" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>This value has to be subtracted from 180° to get the measured particle pitch angle for the high-energy end.</text></s>
<s sid="79"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod3" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The apertures have 7 (LE-end) and 19 (HE-end) entrance holes allowing particles to enter the instrument with a variety of angles relative to the central hole.</text></s>

<s sid="82"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs10" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>However, during the close moon encounters the spacecraft is not rotating and is often reoriented before and after closest approach so that the remote-sensing instruments (camera and spectrometers) have the moon in their field-of-view.</text></s>
<s sid="83"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res24" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>As a consequence the measurable pitch angle of the incoming charged particles also changes which makes the data more difficult to interpret.</text></s>
<s sid="84"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met17" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>MIMI/LEMMS also performs a Pulse Height Analysis (PHA) for the low-energy end separately for the detectors E and F (for electrons with energies of 6.7-2300keV) and for ion detector A (ions with energies of 12-833keV) enabling a good energy resolution of up to 256 channels.</text></s>
<s sid="85"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met18" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>As pointed out by Paranicas et al. (2005) and Roussos et al. (2007) each energy channel of the MIMI/LEMMS instrument measures the sum of a real signal and a background noise signal.</text></s>

<s sid="87"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met20" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>To identify periods where the signal/noise-ratio is good enough checks are performed with data of the omni-directional channel G1 which is primarily counting MeV electrons only.</text></s>
<s sid="88"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met21" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Furthermore if the time vs. intensity curves of electrons measured in the C-channels follow the curves of channel G1 then we do not consider the data in the C-channels to be real.</text></s>
<s sid="89"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res25" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>If the energy of the measured electrons is lower than the resonant energy for a given orbital distance from the planet an absorption feature should be observed only downstream of the moon as described above while the bite-out in the high-energy channels should only be observed upstream of the moon.</text></s>
<s sid="90"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Therefore assuming to a first order that electrons are not deflected from magnetic field gradients and/or flow perturbations and the absorption signature appears on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the moon simultaneous to the high-energy channels it could be an indication of &quot;bad&quot; data.</text></s>

<s sid="99"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met25" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Therefore we concentrate on MIMI/LEMMS measurements of electrons with different energies and with two different pitch angles 180° apart from each other given by the look directions of the low-energy- and high-energy end of the MIMI/LEMMS instrument relative to the local magnetic field.</text></s>

<s sid="290"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con43" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Directly measured charged dust would require that the dust grains entering the low-energy aperture of MIMI/LEMMS are bent in the internal magnetic field towards the electron detector E.

<s sid="291"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con44" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Another consideration could be that a dust grain hitting the E and F low-energy electron detectors triggers the 15keV threshold.</text></s>
<s sid="292"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con45" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Having the corresponding velocity of the incoming dust (17.7km/s) would mean that the dust grain has to have a mass of about 9300amu.</text></s>
<s sid="293"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con46" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, this corresponds to a gyroradius of about 20m, too big to reach directly detector E or F.</text></s>
<s sid="294"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con47" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>From this it follows that incoming dust particles could only hit detector A directly.</text></s>
<s sid="295"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res111" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Finally the fact that we observed some of those peaks in the high-energy aperture HE of MIMI/LEMMS makes it difficult to correlate it with direct dust hits.</text></s>
<s sid="296"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con48" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>As described in the instrumentation section HE consists of a set of five detectors where multiple coincidences between the detectors are used to determine ions or electrons and their energies.</text></s>

<s sid="298"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con50" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This would require that the dust particle entering HE penetrates through the front Aluminum foil, the first detector (150μm thick), the second detector (700μm thick) and gets stuck in detector 3.</text></s>
This is very unlikely.
<s sid="299"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con51" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Directly measured electrons in the corresponding energy ranges cannot be fully ruled out.</text></s>
<s sid="300"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con52" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, the fact that those peaks are highly correlated to the CDA dust measurements would mean that within the high-density plume of gas and dust grains some of the energetic electrons survive and are not lost.</text></s>
<s sid="301"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con53" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We consider this possibility also not very likely.</text></s>
<s sid="302"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con54" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Since the MIMI/LEMMS instrument was not built to measure dust we cannot rule out instrumental issues.</text></s>
<s sid="303"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res112" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>If dust reaches one of the detectors inside the low-energy aperture a cloud of plasma could be produced creating electrons during the impact.</text></s>
<s sid="304"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res113" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, their energies should only extend up to several hundreds of eV to keV range, still too low to be measured by the dedicated electron detectors with a threshold energy of 15keV.</text></s>
<s sid="305"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con55" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Another possibility could be that the power supplies of the various detectors &quot;react&quot; after a massive dust particle hit the detectors, creating a false signal at a huge count rate.</text></s>
<s sid="306"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con56" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Therefore we think that the &quot;dust&quot;-signals in MIMI/LEMMS is a false signal and cannot be used to determine further dust parameters, although they might be caused by the incoming dust grains.</text></s>
