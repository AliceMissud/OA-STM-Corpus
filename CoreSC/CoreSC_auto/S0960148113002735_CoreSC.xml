Introduction
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Wind turbines are typically placed in farms where the turbines are in close proximity to each other.</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>This can have economical benefits due to synergy effects such as common grid connection and infrastructure.</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot2" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>The most common type of wind turbine is the horizontal axis turbine with active pitch control [1].</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This work is devoted to the straight bladed vertical axis turbine without pitch control, whereby the rotational velocity is the only parameter left for control of the turbine.</text></s>

<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res2" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The number of constructed wind farms with straight bladed vertical axis turbines is quite limited, hence limiting the amount of empirical results.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Simulations of vertical axis turbine farms have indicated that such turbines can be placed relatively close to each other with good performance for quite a wide range of incoming wind directions [6-8].</text></s>

The simulations in Ref.

<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Although a rectifier and an inverter for each turbine can be used, a less complex approach is to connect several turbines to the same inverter.</text></s>

<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp1" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>The vertical axis wind turbine in this study is similar to the 200 kW turbine built by Vertical Wind AB [18], which has a turbine height of 24 m, diameter of 26 m and uses a permanent magnet (PM) synchronous generator.</text></s>
Control strategy
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod2" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The tip speed ratio of a turbine is defined as(1)λ=rωV∞,where r is the turbine radius, ω is the rotational velocity and V∞ is the asymptotic wind speed.</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Maximal power absorption occurs at roughly the same tip speed ratio regardless of wind speed.</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Consequently, many control strategies strive to maintain the correct tip speed ratio by adjusting the rotational velocity.</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met5" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Accurate real time wind speed measurements can be used to determine the proper rotational velocity.</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A weakness of this approach is that this data is typically not available.</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A method to control a single turbine without knowledge of the wind speed is presented in Ref.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>[10] and a brief overview is given here: For the given control strategy, there will be an equilibrium where the extracted power equals the turbine power (Pe=P), see Fig. 1.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For maximum power capture, this equilibrium should occur at the tip speed ratio λmax that gives the highest power coefficient CPmax:(2)Pe=P=12CPmaxρAV∞3=12CPmaxρAr3ω3λmax3=k2ω3.</text></s>

<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>(2), the extracted power increases as the cube of the rotational velocity as long as the tip speed ratio and the power coefficient are constant.</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>If the extracted power is higher than the turbine power, the rotational velocity decreases, while it increases if the extracted power is lower.</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For low tip speed ratios, this control strategy may cause the turbine to stop, see Fig. 1.</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In this work a more stable strategy is implemented:(3){Pe=0ω≤ω0,Pe=k1ω2(ω-ω0)ω0&lt;ω≤ω1,Pe=k2ω3ω1&lt;ω≤ω2,Pe=k3ω2(ω-ω2)+k2ω2ω2ω2&lt;ω,where(4)k1=ω1ω1-ω0k2due to continuity at ω=ω1.</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This latter strategy (Fig. 2) maintains a higher rotational velocity at low wind speeds, i.e. the turbine is prevented from stopping at the cost of a slightly lower power coefficient at low and steady wind speeds.</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The purpose of the ω2&lt;ω case is to decrease the tip speed ratio at high wind speeds in order to reduce power absorption and mechanical loads.</text></s>

<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp3" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>The control system starts to extract power for a tip speed ratio of 4 at 3 m/s wind speed, uses the cubical behaviour between wind speeds 4.5 m/s and 9 m/s, and starts to decrease tip speed ratio above.</text></s>
