<TITLE>The modelling of the toughening of epoxy polymers via silica nanoparticles: The effects of volume fraction and particle size
</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>

<s sid="1"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Silica nanoparticles possessing three different diameters (23, 74 and 170 nm) were used to modify a piperidine-cured epoxy polymer.</text></s>
<s sid="2"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res1" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Fracture tests were performed and values of the toughness increased steadily as the concentration of silica nanoparticles was increased.</text></s>
<s sid="3"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res2" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, no significant effects of particle size were found on the measured value of toughness.</text></s>
<s sid="4"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The toughening mechanisms were identified as (i) the formation of localised shear-band yielding in the epoxy matrix polymer which is initiated by the silica nanoparticles, and (ii) debonding of the silica nanoparticles followed by plastic void growth of the epoxy matrix polymer.</text></s>
<s sid="5"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met1" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>These mechanisms, and hence the toughness of the epoxy polymers containing the silica nanoparticles, were modelled using the Hsieh et al. approach (Polymer 51, 2010, 6284-6294).</text></s>
<s sid="6"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, it is noteworthy that previous modelling work has required the volume fraction of debonded silica particles to be measured from the fracture surfaces but in the present paper a new and more fundamental approach has been proposed.</text></s>

<s sid="8"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Statistical analysis showed that, for a good, i.e. random, dispersion of nanoparticles, each nanoparticle has six nearest neighbours, so only one in seven particles would be predicted to debond.</text></s>
<s sid="9"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res4" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This approach therefore predicts that only 14.3% of the nanoparticles present will debond, and this value is in excellent agreement with the value of 10-15% of those nanoparticles present debonding which was recorded via direct observations of the fracture surfaces.</text></s>
<s sid="10"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Further, this value of about 15% of silica nanoparticles particles present debonding has also been noted in other published studies, but has never been previously explained.</text></s>
<s sid="11"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The predictions from the modelling studies of the toughness of the various epoxy polymers containing the silica nanoparticles were compared with the measured fracture energies and the agreement was found to be good.</text></s>

Introduction
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Epoxy polymers are widely used in many different engineering applications, such as coatings, adhesives and matrices in composite materials.</text></s>
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>For example, as coatings, such polymers are employed widely for applications requiring good ultra-violet light protection or high-scratch resistance.</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Their insulating properties, good temperature resistance and ease of processing also allow epoxy polymers to be used extensively in the electronics industry for applications in printed circuit boards and encapsulated electrical components [1].</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met5" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Furthermore, the use of adhesive and composite materials based on epoxy polymers is widespread in the aerospace, automobile and wind-energy industries due to their structural efficiency [2,3].</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Indeed, their outstanding temperature resistance and durability to weathering, fuel, de-icing fluids, etc.</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>leads to them invariably being the preferred materials, compared to acrylics and polyurethanes, for external aerospace applications [1-3].</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Epoxies are amorphous, highly cross-linked, thermosetting polymers which exhibit good elevated temperature resistance and low creep.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, their high cross-link density causes them to be relatively brittle polymers, and this limits their application as structural materials, as they have a poor resistance to the initiation and growth of cracks.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Thus, improvements in their fracture performance are highly sought after by industry [3].</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The addition of silica nanoparticles has been shown to improve these properties without adversely affecting the thermo-mechanical properties of the epoxy polymer [4-8].</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Another advantage [5,6,8-10] is that due to their very small size, and hence large number, then a relatively low volume fraction of such nanoparticles can induce relatively extensive toughening of the epoxy polymer.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Furthermore, the particles are sufficiently small such that when resin transfer moulding manufacturing processes are employed they are not filtered-out of the matrix by the fibre preforms when added to the matrices for fibre-reinforced composite materials [7,9]; where they improve both the fracture and fatigue resistance of the composite material.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Johnsen et al. [10] ascertained that a major toughening mechanism arose from plastic void growth of the epoxy matrix polymer around debonded silica nanoparticles.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Liang and Pearson [11] extended these ideas to show that plastic shear-banding in the epoxy matrix polymer also contributed to the toughening of such modified epoxy polymers.</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These toughening mechanisms were then implemented into a mathematical model proposed by Hsieh et al. [12,13] and such a model was used to predict successfully the fracture energy, GC, of epoxy polymers toughened via the addition of silica nanoparticles.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Further, Giannakopoulos et al. [14] and Chen et al. [15] have shown that this theoretical model also applies to the toughening of epoxy polymers via rubbery core-shell nano-sized particles.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Interestingly, Giannakopoulos et al. [14] also reported that, within experimental error, there was little effect of particle diameter on the increase in toughness resulting from the addition of the core-shell particles, within the range of 100-300 nm.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In the present study, the Hsieh et al. [12,13] model will be used to predict the fracture energy of nanoparticle-modified epoxy polymers, where rigid, amorphous silica nanoparticles of three distinct sizes have been used, at various concentrations, to modify the epoxy polymer.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Further, the previous work discussed above required high-resolution scanning-electron microscopy of the fracture surfaces to be undertaken after the fracture test had been conducted in order to identify the quantitative details of the toughening mechanisms that were required in the predictive mathematical model.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj1" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The present work develops a new approach which enables the modelling results to be deduced from the basic properties of the polymer, i.e. before any fracture tests are undertaken.</text></s>

<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp5" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>The required volume fraction of silica nanoparticles was achieved by blending the silica-DGEBA master-batch with the pure DGEBA, mixing at 85 °C using a mechanical stirrer, and then degassing for 4 h.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp6" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>The silica nanoparticle-epoxy blend was then mixed with five weight percent of piperidine, degassed for a second time and then poured in a release-coated steel mould and cured at 160 °C for 6 h.</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>As expected, the viscosity of the epoxy resin/curing agent mixture increased at higher loadings of silica nanoparticles.</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met6" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>However, the basic epoxy resin/curing agent mixture possessed a relatively low initial viscosity and the increase in viscosity upon addition of the higher concentrations of silica nanoparticles was not considered to be an important aspect of the production of the cast sheets via pouring into, and then curing in, the steel mould.</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met7" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The same batch of material was used as for previous studies [16].</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In Ref. [16] transmission electron microscopy images were given which showed that a good dispersion of silica nanoparticles in the epoxy polymer was achieved, although at the very highest concentration of silica nanoparticles a small degree of agglomeration was observed.</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met8" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The density of the composites was measured using a pycnometer and the calculated densities of the epoxy polymer and silica nanoparticles were 1.16 g/cm3 and 1.92 g/cm3, respectively.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met9" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Using the measured densities, the volume fraction of the silica nanoparticles was calculated from the known weight percentages.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This confirmed that the volume fraction of silica nanoparticles was as stated.</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp7" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>A glass transition temperature of 80 °C was measured for the epoxy polymer using differential scanning calorimetry, and this value was unaffected by the addition of the silica nanoparticles [16].</text></s>
Material characterisation
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp8" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>The Young's modulus, E, and yield stress, σy, of the unmodified and silica nanoparticle-modified epoxies were measured using uniaxial tensile tests.</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp9" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>The bulk polymer samples were machined into a dog-bone shape with dimensions of 63.5 mm long by 3 mm thick, and 3 mm wide in the gauge section.</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp10" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>They were tested at a constant displacement rate of 5 mm/min at room temperature, according to the ASTM-D638 (Type V) standard test method [17], with a minimum of five replicate samples per material type.</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It should be noted that since the present epoxy polymers are all relatively brittle materials it was not possible to obtain meaningful values of the strain to break from uniaxial tensile tests: any such data would be very dependent upon the sample preparation technique employed and will inevitably exhibit a relatively high degree of scatter.</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Indeed, for these reasons plane-strain compression tests have been undertaken of the unmodified epoxy polymer to ascertain the overall yield behaviour of the material, since as expected it failed around the yield point when uniaxial tensile tests were undertaken.</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp11" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>The plane-strain compression tests were conducted as described previously [13].</text></s>

<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs3" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The values of the tensile Young's modulus that were measured are shown in Table 1.</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs4" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>A value of E = 3.50 GPa was measured for the unmodified epoxy polymer.</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The modulus was found to increase steadily with the silica nanoparticle content due to the much higher modulus of the silica particles (i.e. E = 70 GPa) compared with the polymer.</text></s>
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>There was no effect of the particle size, as expected [16].</text></s>
<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs5" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The yield stress, σy, of the unmodified epoxy was measured to be 85 MPa.</text></s>
<s sid="75"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs6" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The addition of the nanoparticles was found to reduce the yield stress slightly and a minimum value of 78 MPa was recorded as shown in Table 1, and again there was no significant effect of particle size.</text></s>
<s sid="76"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>(It should be noted that, as explained in detail below in Section 4.2, strong interfacial adhesion leads to matrix yielding whilst decreased particle-matrix interaction leads to debonding with a corresponding dependence of the yield stress on the particle volume fraction.</text></s>
<s sid="77"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Thus, the reason for the observed slight reduction of the tensile yield stress upon addition of the silica nanoparticles is discussed below.)</text></s>
Fracture energy
<s sid="78"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs7" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The values of the measured fracture toughness, KC, and fracture energy, GC, for the epoxy polymers are listed in Table 1, and the values of the fracture energy are plotted as a function of the volume fraction of silica nanoparticles in Fig. 1.</text></s>
<s sid="79"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A value of GC = 303 J/m2 was measured for the unmodified epoxy, and this value is in good agreement with values previously reported in the literature [11].</text></s>
<s sid="80"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The addition of the silica nanoparticles increased the values of the toughness, and the increase is approximately linear after an initial relatively steep increase at 2.5 vol%.</text></s>
<s sid="81"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The effect of the presence of the silica nanoparticles is clearly major, with the epoxy polymers containing 30 vol% of such particles having values of GC of about 1000 J/m2.</text></s>
<s sid="82"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res21" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>As discussed in detail previously [16], there is no significant effect of the particle size, within experimental error, on the measured values of the fracture energy with the addition of silica nanoparticles, within the range studied of 23-170 nm in particle diameter (see Fig. 1).</text></s>
<s sid="83"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res22" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This observation also agrees with previous work, which showed no effect of particle diameter between 20 and 80 nm [11].</text></s>

<s sid="90"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res25" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This indicates the presence of shear yielding (i.e. plastic shear banding) in the epoxy matrix polymer, as the plastic shear deformation causes orientation of the polymer molecules which rotates the plane of the polarised light and leads to a bright image.</text></s>

<s sid="102"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res32" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It can be argued that the coating used to make the fracture surfaces of the samples conductive has obscured the evidence of debonding from the matrix, and the subsequent void growth of the epoxy polymer.</text></s>
<s sid="103"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res33" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Therefore, several studies were undertaken to change the thickness of the chromium coating, but there was still no evidence of plastic void growth having occurred.</text></s>

<s sid="219"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res103" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>By this definition the mean number of neighbours is equivalent to the mean number of Delaunay triangles per unique vertex (particle).</text></s>
<s sid="220"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res104" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Thus, for a micrograph containing N dispersed particles, there will be N Voronoi polygons, i.e. one for each particle.</text></s>
<s sid="221"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res105" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>When the Delaunay tessellation is generated there must be 2N Delaunay triangles in the micrograph.</text></s>
<s sid="222"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res106" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>As there are three vertices per triangle then the total number of triangle vertices is 3 × 2N = 6N.</text></s>
<s sid="223"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res107" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Now, each particle is a potential position for a vertex, and multiple vertices can lie on a particle.</text></s>
<s sid="224"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res108" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Thus, the mean number of vertices on one particle must be equal to the total number of vertices divided by the number of particles = 6N/N = 6.</text></s>
<s sid="225"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res109" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>As each vertex connects the particle with its nearest neighbours then the number of nearest neighbours is exactly six.</text></s>
<s sid="226"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res110" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This above methodology reveals that once one particle debonds and void growth occurs, then its six nearest neighbours will not debond.</text></s>
<s sid="227"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res111" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Hence only one in seven particles will exhibit debonding and void growth, which gives a value of the percentage of debonding particles as 14.3% of those present.</text></s>
<s sid="228"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res112" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This prediction agrees very well with the experimental observations from the fracture surfaces.</text></s>
<s sid="229"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res113" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Indeed, Hsieh et al. reported that in their studies the experimental observations indicated that 15 ± 5% of the nanoparticles present exhibited debonding and void growth [12,13] and, in the current work, 10-15% of the nanoparticles were observed to show debonding and void growth.</text></s>
<s sid="230"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res114" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The results from both of these studies clearly agree very well with the above prediction of 14.3%.</text></s>
<s sid="231"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res115" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Comparisons between the predicted and experimental toughness</text></s>
<s sid="232"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res116" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The modelling scheme outlined above was employed to calculate the values of ΔGs and ΔGv using the parameters given in Table 2.</text></s>
<s sid="233"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res117" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The results are compared with the measured fracture energies in Fig. 8.</text></s>
<s sid="234"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res118" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In this Figure the modelling results are shown as lines considering the contribution to the fracture energy, Gc, due to (i) plastic shear-band yielding in the epoxy matrix polymer only and (ii) plastic shear-band yielding and plastic void growth in the epoxy matrix polymer but arising from only 14.3% of those nanoparticles present being active in terms of initiating this latter debonding and the plastic void growth toughening mechanism.</text></s>
<s sid="235"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res119" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The individual contributions to the toughness from shear-band yielding and plastic void growth of the epoxy matrix polymer are shown in Table 3, where it again should be noted that the predicted values of GC assume that the toughening increment, ΔGv, from the plastic void growth mechanism arises from only 14.3% of the particles present.</text></s>
<s sid="236"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res120" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Fig. 8 shows that the model which considers both toughening mechanisms generally under-predicts the measured fracture energy at low particle contents, and may somewhat over-predict the toughness at high volume fractions.</text></s>
<s sid="237"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res121" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, for all of the different particle diameters, a good agreement with the experimental data was obtained using the model that takes into account both the shear-banding yielding and the debonding and subsequent plastic void growth mechanisms in the epoxy matrix polymer, when the predicted value of about 14% of the nanoparticles present only are active in the latter toughening mechanism.</text></s>
<s sid="238"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thus, the modelling, as well as the experimental studies, clearly confirm the important role of debonding of the nanoparticles which enables subsequent plastic void growth to occur in the epoxy matrix polymer; and the fact that it is only initiated and occurs via a relatively low percentage of the nanoparticles present due to stress-shielding of those nanoparticles immediately adjacent to a void.</text></s>
<s sid="239"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>As noted above, the shear-banding term in the model is dependent on particle size, i.e. smaller particles provide a greater contribution to the value of ΔGs, whereas the plastic void growth term, ΔGv, is independent of particle size.</text></s>
<s sid="240"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs19" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>However, Table 3 shows that the ΔGs contributions for the three particle diameters studied and there is no significant difference between the values for any given volume fraction of particles.</text></s>
<s sid="241"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs20" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>For example, for 30 vol% of nanosilica particles, ΔGs = 300 J/m2 for the 23 nm diameter particles, 299 J/m2 for the 74 nm diameter particles, and 297 J/m2 for the 170 nm diameter particles.</text></s>
<s sid="242"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Hence, over the range of particle sizes used in the present work the model predicts that there is no significant effect of particle diameter on the predicted toughness.</text></s>
<s sid="243"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con19" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This agrees very well with the experimental data, where no size effect was seen.</text></s>
<s sid="244"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con20" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Finally, for the 23 nm diameter particles, it is unlikely that all the observed toughening effect could arise from shear yielding alone.</text></s>
<s sid="245"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con21" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Since there is no significant difference in the measured GC for any particle diameter for a given volume fraction of silica nanoparticles; and noting that the other two particle size particles experimentally, as well as theoretically, showed debonding and void growth.</text></s>
<s sid="246"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thus, also observing that the contribution of the plastic void growth mechanism to the fracture energy, ΔGv, is predicted to be independent of particle size, it is suggested that particle debonding and subsequent plastic void growth in the epoxy polymer does indeed occur for the 23 nm diameter particles but that it is obscured by the coating process when the FEG-SEM observations are made.</text></s>
<s sid="247"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This confirms that it is very useful to be able to predict the toughening mechanisms associated with such small particles, rather than relying solely upon observations of the fracture surfaces.</text></s>
Conclusions
<s sid="248"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Silica nanoparticles possessing three different diameters (23, 74 and 170 nm) were used to modify a piperidine-cured epoxy polymer.</text></s>
<s sid="249"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res122" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Fracture tests were performed and the values of the toughness increased steadily as the concentration of silica-nanoparticles was increased, but with no significant effects of particle size being observed.</text></s>
<s sid="250"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con25" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The toughening mechanisms were identified as (i) the formation of localised shear-band yielding in the epoxy matrix polymer which is initiated by the silica nanoparticles, and (ii) debonding of the silica nanoparticles followed by plastic void growth of the epoxy matrix polymer.</text></s>
<s sid="251"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con26" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These toughening mechanisms, and hence the toughness of the epoxy polymers containing the silica nanoparticles, were modelled.</text></s>
<s sid="252"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con27" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However, previously, the percentage of nanoparticles that actually initiate this latter mechanism of debonding and subsequent plastic void growth of the epoxy matrix polymer, was calculated by observations from the fracture surfaces after the fracture test had been performed.</text></s>
<s sid="253"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con28" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The present paper has obtained the value of this important parameter via firstly developing a finite-element model of a number of particles in the epoxy polymer.</text></s>
<s sid="254"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res123" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This model showed that once one silica nanoparticle debonds and forms a void, then its nearest neighbours are shielded from the applied stress-field and hence will not debond.</text></s>
<s sid="255"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res124" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A statistical analysis, using Delaunay triangles, was then employed which revealed that, for a random dispersion of nanoparticles, each nanoparticle has exactly six nearest neighbours, so only one in seven particles will debond.</text></s>
<s sid="256"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res125" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This predicted value of 14.3% of the particles present that will actually debond, and hence lead to subsequent plastic void growth in the epoxy matrix polymer, was in excellent agreement with the observation from the fracture surfaces that about 10-15% of the nanoparticles present debonded.</text></s>
<s sid="257"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res126" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Indeed, this value of about 15% only of the silica nanoparticles particles present debonding has also been noted in other published studies, but has never been previously explained.</text></s>
<s sid="258"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con29" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thus, the predictions from the modelling studies of the toughness may now be undertaken without the need for any fracture tests to be first conducted, i.e. a priori from the basic material properties of the modified epoxy polymers.</text></s>
<s sid="259"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con30" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The predicted fracture energies of the various epoxy polymers containing the silica nanoparticles were so deduced and compared with the measured fracture energies.</text></s>
<s sid="260"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con31" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The agreement was found to be good.</text></s>
<s sid="261"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con32" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Further, for example, over the range of particle diameters (i.e. from 23 nm to 170 nm) used in the present work the model predicted that there is no effect of particle diameter on the toughness, as was indeed observed from the experimental data.</text></s>
