Introduction
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>There is fierce competition between solution and vacuum processed organic photovoltaics [1,2].</text></s>
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The former relies on morphology control in polymer-fullerene blends resulting from phase separation in these systems [3-5].</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The latter takes advantage of solvent-free processing allowing highly complex multi-junction architectures [6] similar to inorganic photovoltaics.</text></s>

<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj1" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In this work, we combine these approaches by co-depositing polymer-fullerene bulk heterojunctions using vacuum thermal evaporation.</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We show that morphology and performance can be controlled by polymer-fullerene composition ratio and post-production thermal annealing.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A route to merge the useful aspects of both material systems to further enhance device efficiencies is identified, which goes beyond current small-molecule (molecular) photovoltaics.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The intimate blend of donor and acceptor in a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) allows efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction through an interpenetrated nanoscale network of the two phases [9].</text></s>

<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In solution processing, the two most common ways of controlling morphology are choice of solvent [12,13] and application of post-production thermal annealing [14,15].</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Vacuum co-deposition of small molecules allows gradient blends and therefore precise manipulation of horizontal as well as vertical donor-acceptor composition [16,17].</text></s>

<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The molecules retain their chemical composition and structure after evaporation, but decrease in molecular weight.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In a following study on planar heterojunction devices we have shown that vacuum-deposited polymer without side-groups, polythiophene (PTh), exhibits enhanced molecular packing and crystallinity as compared to its soluble counterpart poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT).</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This resulted in significantly improved charge transport properties with relatively high hole mobilities (10-4cm2/Vs) and almost a 70% increase in power conversion efficiency [37].</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res21" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Moreover, the lack of side groups accounted for a considerably longer conjugation length of the evaporated polymer.</text></s>

Results and discussion
Optimization of annealing conditions
<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp24" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>The performance and morphology of vacuum co-deposited BHJs was studied through variation of four main parameters-active layer thickness, polymer-fullerene composition and post-production thermal annealing temperature and time.</text></s>
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>In order to see the effect of annealing on different PTh:C60 compositions, optimization of the annealing temperature and time had to be performed.</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res27" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A series of initial experiments indicated that BHJ with 80vol% of C60 and a thickness of 70nm lead to device characteristics comparable to the previously reported planar heterojunction devices (Jsc∼2-3mA/cm2 and Voc∼0.40-0.45V) [37].</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res28" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This composition thus served as a good standard for optimization of the annealing parameters.</text></s>
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>First, an optimal temperature was found by annealing the devices for 10min at different temperatures (100, 120, 140 and 160°C), and subsequently, the optimal annealing time was found for the optimized temperature (from 5, 15, 30 and 60min annealing at 120°C).</text></s>
<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Both steps are shown in Fig. 1a and b.</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res29" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The best performance was obtained for 30min annealing at 120°C, the temperature previously assigned by Chen et al. to the glass transition of PTh [38].</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res30" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The glass transition of the PTh:C60 system might, however, be lower if C60 acts as a plasticizer of PTh [39].</text></s>
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res31" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The resulting increase in photocurrent was approximately 35% and PCE increased by 55%.</text></s>
<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res32" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We also observed that above 120°C the value of Voc consistently decreases.</text></s>
<s sid="75"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res33" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This could be a result of excessive crystallization of one of the phases (shown in the inset of Fig. 1a) and formation of shunt paths.</text></s>

<s sid="82"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs5" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Fig. 2a shows that increasing polymer content (up to 60%) results in improved current generation which in turn seems to be the main factor that drives the PCE in this BHJ system.</text></s>
<s sid="83"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res36" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Enhanced diode characteristics in light and dark curves, Fig. 2a (40-80% PTh), and decreasing series resistance Rs, Table 1 (40-60% PTh), are all consistent with the photocurrent increase.</text></s>

<s sid="85"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res38" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This improvement in absorption, however, could only be partially responsible for the Jsc increase, as the trend in absorption with PTh content does not correlate well with that in Jsc.</text></s>
<s sid="86"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res39" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The low fill factor (FF) suggests charge recombination and any improvement with increasing PTh content (for non-annealed devices) is minor.</text></s>

<s sid="88"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res41" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, we observe a systematic decrease in Voc, apparent in Fig. 2b, which we attribute to decreasing shunt resistance Rsh of the devices (Table 1).</text></s>

<s sid="93"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res46" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Thermal annealing not only improves the photocurrent, but also increases Rsh of the devices (for 40-60% PTh) and subsequently enhances the values of Voc.</text></s>
<s sid="94"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res47" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This could occur via the sealing of shunt paths created during the film growth [46].</text></s>
<s sid="95"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res48" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The exception is at 80% PTh, for which a rather unexpected drop in Rsh is calculated.</text></s>

<s sid="127"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res63" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Development of the donor-acceptor network on annealing is driven by crystallization and re-arrangement of C60 on phase separation from the PTh [62-65].</text></s>
<s sid="128"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res64" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The coherence length of the polymer crystals, ξ=110Å, was obtained from the peak 200 (non-annealed sample) using Debye-Sherrer relation [66].</text></s>

<s sid="131"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs8" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>In order to relate photovoltaic performance of the devices to their phase morphology, AFM topographic and phase-contrast studies were performed, with representative images summarized in Fig. 5.</text></s>
<s sid="132"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs9" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The value of root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness, taken from multiple samples and scan areas, is shown in Fig. 6a.</text></s>

<s sid="134"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs11" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Their quantification is represented by the average peak-to-peak distance of domains in the phase images, as shown in Fig. 6b (rather than intending to measure the polymer/fullerene domain size, these figures evaluate relative differences in the phase morphology of the blends, at least at the surface of the specimen).</text></s>
<s sid="135"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res67" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The trend of RMS roughness reaches a minimum at the PTh composition between 40% and 60% (see Fig. 6a).</text></s>
<s sid="136"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res68" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This central range also correlates with the peak of the BHJ performance, indicating that better donor-acceptor balance within the network has not only an impact on surface morphology, but also on the inner distribution of the phases and related enhanced charge extraction.</text></s>
<s sid="137"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res69" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Overall values of less than 3.5nm suggest a fine morphology in all blends.</text></s>
<s sid="138"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res70" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This is in contrast with 6T:C60 films which were shown to exhibit microcrystalline segregation of sexithiophene with RMS∼15-20nm at its 50% content [45].</text></s>
<s sid="139"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res71" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The effect of thermal treatment on RMS roughness is minor.</text></s>
<s sid="140"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res72" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Even for large content of PTh (80%) the increase in roughness is only around 30%.</text></s>
<s sid="141"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res73" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This particular difference can, however, explain the decrease in Rsh of the 80% PTh devices taking place after annealing, as shown in Table 1.</text></s>
<s sid="142"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res74" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In general, low RMS values confirm that a moderate morphological development takes place in annealed vacuum-deposited blends similar to polymer-fullerene systems.</text></s>

<s sid="144"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res76" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Moreover, there is a considerable development of the domain network upon annealing in all heterojunction films, as shown in Fig. 5 and Figs.</text></s>

<s sid="145"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con14" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>For 40-80% PTh, the network coarsens which could suggest phase separation within the blends.</text></s>
<s sid="146"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This would be consistent with annealing-induced phase separation of polythiophene indicated by the XRD findings, and the enhancement of Jsc in BHJ devices.</text></s>
<s sid="147"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res77" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The overall trend of the domain sizes corresponds well with that of the cells' ability to generate photocurrent (see Fig. 2).</text></s>
<s sid="148"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This implies that the self-assembled phase network reaches its optimal dimensions around 60% PTh when the values of Jsc culminate.</text></s>
<s sid="149"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The AFM study therefore confirms that the phase morphology can be controlled without detrimental large-scale segregation and thus optimized by both donor-acceptor composition and post-situ thermal treatment.</text></s>
Conclusions
<s sid="150"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Vacuum-deposited PTh:C60 bulk heterojunctions with different donor-acceptor compositions were fabricated and the effect of post-production thermal annealing on their photovoltaic performance and morphology studied.</text></s>
<s sid="151"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con19" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We showed that co-deposition of blended mixtures leads to 60% higher photocurrents than in thickness-optimized PTh/C60 planar heterojunction counterparts [37].</text></s>
<s sid="152"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con20" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Furthermore, by annealing the devices post-situ we improved their power conversion efficiency by as much as 80%, achieving performance comparable to PTh:PCBM equivalents processed in solution from thermo-cleavable precursors [52].</text></s>
<s sid="153"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con21" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>An enhanced photoresponse results from the favorable morphological development of PTh upon annealing, modestly larger grain sizes and increased crystallization of C60.</text></s>
<s sid="154"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In contrast to most small-molecule blends, annealing-induced phase separation does not lead to formation of microcrystals but rather to a controlled improvement of the donor-acceptor network.</text></s>
<s sid="155"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This is an inherent advantage of polymers over molecular systems.</text></s>
<s sid="156"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Although overall performance of the PTh:C60 devices does not match that of solution-cast P3HT:PCBM (average PCE 3%) [69], we emphasize that PTh is not optimized to form a heterojunction with C60 in the same way that P3HT is optimized for solution-processed heterojunction with PCBM.</text></s>
<s sid="157"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con25" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Better molecular design is necessary to adjust the energy levels of the polymer and thus improve absorption as well as its alignment with the acceptor for greater Voc.</text></s>
<s sid="158"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con26" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Finally, we have demonstrated that the morphology of vacuum-deposited PTh:C60 bulk heterojunctions can be controlled over a wide range of compositions.</text></s>
<s sid="159"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con27" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The next step is to achieve further control of phase-separation, for example, by co-depositing less miscible materials, such as polymeric donor and polymeric acceptor, or optimizing the molecular weight of the starting materials.</text></s>
