Introduction
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj9" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Swash on steep beaches is characterised by wave breaking followed by bore collapse on the beach slope.</text></s>
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The flow velocities generated by bore collapse can be very high, up to 5m/s according to Hughes (1992), and the corresponding run-up on the beach can extend many metres.</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met5" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The swash zone is therefore a highly dynamic region of the beach, complicated in hydrodynamic terms because the flow is turbulent, highly unsteady and highly non-uniform, and in morphological terms because sediment fluxes are high and vary greatly across the swash zone.</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met6" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>While many studies of swash carried out in the field have yielded useful insights (e.g. Austin and Masselink, 2006; Hughes, 1992; Masselink and Hughes, 1998; Puleo et al., 2000) fundamental aspects of swash are arguably best studied in controlled laboratory experiments because of the complexity of the processes at work.</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj10" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Table 1 lists previous laboratory studies which have investigated breaking wave and bore hydrodynamics in the swash zone, focused on the detailed hydrodynamics, the turbulence and, in some cases, the bed shear stress for smooth and rough impermeable beach slopes.</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj11" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The majority of the studies have been carried out in small-scale laboratory wave flumes.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj12" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>There are two disadvantages in using small wave flumes to study bore collapse on beaches.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The first is that the relatively small scale leads to substantial scale effects in relation to roughness, permeability and sediment behaviour; the second is that the magnitudes of swash depths, velocities and maximum run-up are relatively small, making it more difficult to obtain accurate measurements of the key fundamental processes.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met7" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>An alternative method for generating a controlled swash event in the laboratory is to generate a large-scale bore through dam-break.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met8" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>A deep reservoir of water is separated from a shallow body of water by a partition that can be removed at high speed.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met9" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>After partition removal, the released water plunges and generates a bore travelling away from the reservoir.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res1" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Subsequent bore collapse on a sloping beach located downstream results in a large-scale swash event with run-up that is an order of magnitude larger than swash run-up generated by waves on a sloping beach in a typical laboratory wave flume.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The large scale of the swash means that scale effects are avoided and accurate measurements of the more detailed hydrodynamics are possible.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This kind of set-up was used by Yeh (1991) and more recently by Barnes et al. (2009) and O'Donoghue et al. (2010).</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The dam-break swash experiment belongs to a larger family of dam-break experiments, which includes, for example, dam-break induced sediment transport on horizontal beds (e.g. Zech et al., 2008), 2D dam-break hydraulics (e.g. Aureli et al., 2008) and dam-break bore travel on a downward inclining slope (e.g. Chanson, 2004).</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj13" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The present paper reports new experiments designed to study the detailed hydrodynamics of large-scale bore-driven swash on impermeable, rough beach slopes.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The experiments were carried out on three impermeable 1:10 slopes with different surface roughness in order to investigate the effect of roughness on the hydrodynamics.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met10" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The experiments use a similar setup to that of O'Donoghue et al. (2010) but add substantially to the previous work by extending the range of beach roughness and by better resolution of the hydrodynamics through improved measurement methods, namely, the use of Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) to better resolve flow depth and the use of an improved particle image velocimetry (PIV) system capable of measuring bed-normal as well as bed-parallel velocities.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met11" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In addition, flow depth and velocity are measured simultaneously in the present study allowing a more thorough and rigorous analysis of the depth-averaged and ensemble-averaged velocities and the turbulence quantities.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The paper is structured as follows.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res2" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Section 2 describes the experimental set-up and measurement methods and demonstrates the high repeatability and consistency of the measurements.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Section 3 presents the experimental results: ensemble-averaged results for flow depth, shoreline position, depth-averaged velocity and velocity profiles are presented first, followed by results for turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds stress; results for bed shear stress complete the section.</text></s>

<s sid="103"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs8" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>There is very little variability in the depth-averaged velocity results up to the time of maximum backwash velocity, after which the relatively small flow depths and high velocities cause high levels of bed-generated turbulence throughout the flow column.</text></s>
<s sid="104"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met36" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Note that, unlike capacitance gauges which have been used in previous swash measurements, LIF enables depth measurements to be made late into the backwash when depths are very small and velocities are high.</text></s>
