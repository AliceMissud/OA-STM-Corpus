Introduction
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot2" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Semiconductor quantum dots (QD) are of interest not only as an academic curiosity but also because these nanoparticles show potential as biological labels, photocatalysts, and nanoelectronic devices [1-3].</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot3" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>QDs offer a wide range of properties accessible via manipulation of size, chemistry, band gap and photoluminescent properties [4].</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot4" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>In this context, the fabrication of nano inorganic-organic hybrid materials is of particular interest, as the resulting materials may potentially possess the combined characteristics of the two original components [5].</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj5" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Cadmium-based QDs (e.g. cadmium sulfide (CdS)) are considered attractive for the aforementioned applications due to their bright emission in the visible and near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum [6].</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>However, these semiconductor QDs have a number of application problems associated with the unsuitability of the capping agents employed (e.g. in a biological environment), the retention of particles over a certain size, magnification (e.g. in cells), or degradation/decomposition of these inorganic QD materials.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met6" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>To circumvent these problems a variety of synthetic strategies have been employed to stabilise such QDs [7].</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met7" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>One promising approach is to employ materials (e.g. polymers) that provide coordination sites for Cd2+ and in turn stabilise the forming QD phase (e.g. CdS) during synthesis [8].</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met8" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Therefore, the use of natural polysaccharides seems appropriate as these sugar polymers are relatively inexpensive and can provide functionality, biocompatibility, abundance and nontoxicity [9].</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met9" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The preparation of QDs enclosed within the porous structure of a biocompatible polymer would offer a route to suitably capped or protected materials for biomedical applications (e.g. imaging) [8].</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met10" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The advantages of both the QDs and polymeric support could then be combined when the active component (e.g. the QD) is dispersed and stabilised within a biocompatible, inexpensive and potentially highly porous, network [8,10].</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In this context aqueous phase or &quot;wet&quot; colloidal chemistry approaches to the synthesis of nanomaterials can take inspiration from bio-mineralisation; that is the growth of inorganic crystals within the confines of biological systems - with the use of porous polysaccharide-derived materials seemingly a perfect match for the aforementioned criteria.</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The inspiration for this work comes from our and others previous reports on porous polysaccharide-supported metallic nanoparticles, and also from a number of literature reports detailing the synthesis of (non-porous) saccharide-capped CdS nanoparticles [8-12].</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Previously, a wide variety of metallic nanoparticles (e.g. Pd, Au, Ag, etc.) have been protected using polysaccharides (e.g. starch, amylose, cellulose), finding application predominantly in absorption and catalysis [11].</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa3" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Polysaccharides (and saccharides) have previously been employed to stabilise QDs (including CdS) [12], but significantly there have thus far been no reports that describe the use of porous polysaccharides (e.g. mesoporous starch) in the preparation of high surface area, (meso)porous QDs/polysaccharide hybrids.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The polysaccharides, and indeed mesoporous forms of these biopolymers, would seem ideal vehicles to contain the growth of QDs to suitable sizes whilst at the same time providing in principle a biologically compatible transport media.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj6" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Here, the synthesis of high surface area, CdS/mesoporous starch (MS) hybrids are presented, where the unique environment of a starch gel is utilised to confine the growth of the CdS phase.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj7" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The presented materials have been characterised using X-ray diffraction, N2 sorption, transmission electron microscopy and diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible light spectroscopy.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj8" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The CdS/MS materials, prepared at increasing CdS/starch (w/w) ratios, are synthesised in a straightforward manner based on green chemistry principles [13], demonstrating the straightforward, utile and transferable nature of the presented approach.</text></s>

<s sid="76"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp37" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>Pure control samples of MS and CdS were also prepared to provide comparison.</text></s>
<s sid="77"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>CdS/MS materials were prepared at increasing cadmium to starch ratios (w/w) and the bright yellow colouration observed during the addition of the reagents to the starch gel was maintained in the recovered solid with (as expected) a higher loading of CdS indicated by an increasingly stronger yellow appearance (Fig. 1).</text></s>

This shift of ca.

<s sid="101"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The observed spectral shifts observed here might also be the result of initial CdS formation at hydroxyl sites within the (micro or small meso) pores, followed by a migration to the surface, as all pore sites are filled.</text></s>

<s sid="111"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con3" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Presumably this material nanostructuring is the product of a complimentary self-assembly between polysaccharide nanocrystallites, which are uniformly coated with forming CdS species during synthesis.</text></s>
<s sid="112"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Given the N2 sorption isotherm profiles and corresponding pore size distributions, it potentially can be inferred that there exists a degree of complimentary, self-organisation and arrangement between the starch gel and forming phase CdS phase during synthesis resulting firstly in an increase in the overall textural &quot;quality&quot; in the final porous products.</text></s>
<s sid="113"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Given the density of CdS (ρ=4.83gcm-3) and that loading is based on 1.0g of the MS support, the actual pore volume of starch support for CdS1, can be estimated as &gt;1.5cm3g-1; notably three times higher than the original MS control sample.</text></s>
<s sid="114"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con6" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Such a reorganisation and restructuring of the polysaccharide phase with increasing CdS loading can potentially be explained by repulsive forces and changes in surface charge as the porous hybrid structure is formed, generating the observed higher total pore volumes and expansion of the corresponding pore size distributions (Fig. 4).</text></s>
<s sid="115"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con7" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In the context of the presented synthesis, the polysaccharide (i.e. here a predominantly amylose) gel, given its metastable hydrogen-bonded network, will be sensitive to alterations in the ionic potential of the aquagel system/pore walls in the gel phase (e.g. from salts (e.g. sodium acetate by-product) or the forming CdS phase), which may act to reorganise the network during the solvent exchange process.</text></s>
<s sid="116"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con8" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Coordination of Cd2+ with the gel surface via hydroxyl pairs, possibly from adjacent polysaccharide chains, will alter the local &quot;polysaccharide&quot; ordering.</text></s>
<s sid="117"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con9" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The metastable polysaccharide &quot;gel&quot; may be expected to order itself to minimise surface energy in this dynamic system, with the pore dimensions presumably adapting to accommodate the introduction of a charged species (e.g. Cd2+).</text></s>
<s sid="118"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con10" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is important to note that the divalent cation Cd2+ has an ionic radius of 0.097nm [22], which leads to a number of speculative points; (1) the diameter of the cation is smaller than the internal cavity of the amylose helix (double or single; ca.</text></s>
<s sid="119"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con11" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>0.4-1.0nm), which itself is presumably flexible under the synthesis conditions to accommodate introduction of the Cd2+ into its hydrophobic cavity (perhaps occupying micropores (Table 1); (2) the diameter is also approximately the same length as the (OH) H-bonding distances (i.e. 0.19-0.21nm) [23] between adjacent glucose residues that form the amylose helix (believed to be key to the formation of the porous polysaccharide phase); [15,24] consequently coordination of Cd2+ may stabilise an alternative metastable polysaccharide confirmation(s), gel state and in turn expanded surface properties.</text></s>
<s sid="120"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res36" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It is thought that at low loadings (e.g. CdS3), Cd2+ is adsorbed initially within the (smaller) pores of MS, leading to a nanoconfinement of the forming CdS phase.</text></s>
<s sid="121"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con12" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>CdS will nucleate here presumably according to a pseudo-epitaxial growth, generating confined, amorphous nanoparticles or &quot;seeds&quot; (as indicated from XRD data).</text></s>
<s sid="122"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con13" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>As CdS nanoparticles grow and fill the porous domains as loading increases, the polysaccharide structure remains flexible, particularly in the presence of water (or water/alcohol mixtures), and the hydrogen bond network may then rearrange accordingly to accommodate the inorganic phase.</text></s>
<s sid="123"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con14" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>As the CdS clusters grow in size (and becoming increasingly crystalline) in the mesopores, the electrostatic repulsion increases the average pore size but with no reduction in surface area presumably as a consequence of an increased primary particle separation within the gel phase.</text></s>
<s sid="124"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This is an interesting observation and may lead to the synthesis of a variety of polysaccharide/inorganic hybrids and templated materials, as well as the potential to utilise ionic potential to direct textural properties of polysaccharide gels and associated porous xero- and aerogels.</text></s>
Conclusions
<s sid="125"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>A series of mesoporous starch-supported CdS materials have been prepared using a relatively simple process employing an inexpensive, biomass-derived polysaccharide support, to immobilise the forming quantum dot nanoparticle phase.</text></s>
<s sid="126"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The resulting materials were characterised by a variety of techniques demonstrating the formation of a cubic CdS phase upon a high surface area, mesoporous polysaccharide-derived support phase.</text></s>
<s sid="127"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The complimentary interaction of the porous polysaccharide (starch) gel and the growing CdS inorganic phase and the resulting electrostatic repulsive forces generated materials with very high nanoparticle loadings, surprisingly high surface area, volumes and small CdS species.</text></s>
<s sid="128"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con19" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The synthesis is relatively simple and potentially scalable.</text></s>
<s sid="129"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con20" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Initially based on the use here of porous polysaccharide powders, the synthetic approach should be extendable to the preparation of porous CdS/polysaccharide films and monoliths.</text></s>
<s sid="130"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con21" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Selection of polysaccharide type and quantum dot chemistry potentially may lead to the synthesis of a variety of porous polysaccharide-derived materials as supports for QDs.</text></s>
<s sid="131"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The polysaccharides are typically transparent to incident radiation with of λ&gt;410nm, rendering materials potentially suitable for sensor applications and biological environments.</text></s>
<s sid="132"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is important to note that the presented results are somewhat unexpected given previous work (e.g. a pore filling model with PdNPs) [11(b)], and highlights the unusual nature of these porous polysaccharide networks - via the introduction of charged species and growth of CdS nanoparticles within the porous structure, the material porosity adapts, presumably as the flexible soft, biopolymer network adapts its porosity to accommodate the growing CdS phase.</text></s>
<s sid="133"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This demonstrates a certain responsive quality to the porous polysaccharide network and affinity for Cd2+ whereby it is possible to enhance textural and porous properties of the material via the loading and stabilisation of CdS nanoparticles.</text></s>
