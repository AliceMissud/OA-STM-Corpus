Introduction
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj5" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The Cenomanian-Turonian boundary (CTB) OAE 2 records an extensive period of global anoxia, represented worldwide by sections containing organic-rich marine sedimentary rocks.</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Strata marking the onset of OAE 2 are globally correlated by a 2 to 4‰ positive excursion in the carbon stable isotope composition of organic matter (δ13Corg) and marine carbonates (δ13Ccarb), which are interpreted to reflect the onset of massive organic carbon burial and widespread oxygen deficiency in the oceans (Jenkyns, 1980; Schlanger et al., 1987).</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The OAE 2 has been studied using numerous proxies (e.g. carbon, strontium, osmium, calcium, neodymium, lithium, TEX86 and phosphorus; Arthur et al., 1987; McArthur et al., 2004; Forster et al., 2007; Mort et al., 2007; MacLeod et al., 2008; Turgeon and Creaser, 2008; Voigt et al., 2008; Blättler et al., 2011; Pogge von Strandmann et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2013) to determine the driving mechanisms for organic carbon burial and anoxia.</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Among the processes thought to play a role are: enhanced volcanism and CO2 output; increased land and sea surface temperatures; an accelerated hydrological cycle, sea level rise and increased rates of ocean circulation; and changes in nutrient supply and productivity.</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These have all been supported by different proxy studies (e.g. Jenkyns, 1980; Arthur et al., 1987; Arthur and Sageman, 1994; Mort et al., 2007; Turgeon and Creaser, 2008; Martin et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj6" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In this study, we present a high-resolution initial osmium isotope (187Os/188Os; Osi) stratigraphy of the upper Cenomanian to lower Turonian from 4 transcontinental sections, and the Osi data from two previously analyzed representative sections of the proto-North Atlantic and Tethyan margin (Fig. 1; ODP Site 1260 and Furlo; Turgeon and Creaser, 2008) with additional analysis to enhance resolution.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These data are predominantly controlled by the mass balance of two end-member Os isotope components: weathered continental crust (∼1.4) and mantle inputs (0.13) attributed to enhanced submarine volcanism (Peucker-Ehrenbrink and Ravizza, 2000).</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This, coupled with the short residence time of Os in seawater (⩽10 kyr; Oxburgh, 2001), makes 187Os/188Os composition an excellent monitor of palaeoceanographic changes in the geological record (Peucker-Ehrenbrink and Ravizza, 2000; Cohen, 2004), particularly across the CTB where there is evidence for accelerated weathering, as well as evidence of submarine volcanic activity (Snow et al., 2005; Frijia and Parente, 2008; Turgeon and Creaser, 2008; Pogge von Strandmann et al., 2013).</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Analysis of osmium isotope trends recorded from different sites provides information about changes in these inputs to the marine realm, as well as the interconnectivity of oceanic water masses with epeiric seas.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The Osi data reported from the previous study show similar profiles, and suggest that for at least ∼700 kyr of the late Cenomanian-early Turonian the ocean basins were relatively well connected.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The Osi data also show that a major pulse of volcanism interpreted to be associated with activity from Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs), i.e., Caribbean and High Arctic (Fig. 1; Snow et al., 2005; Tegner et al., 2011) occurred at or just prior to the onset of OAE 2.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, the High Arctic LIP is largely understudied due to lack of exposure.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Since constraints on timing and duration of activity from LIP volcanism are ambiguous (Tegner et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2013), we associate the Osi data presented here with activity from the better temporally constrained Caribbean LIP (Turgeon and Creaser, 2008).</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The Osi stratigraphic profiles across the CTB in this study are from (Fig. 1): the Portland #1 core, which is representative of the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) near Pueblo, Colorado (Western Interior Seaway (WIS); Kennedy et al., 2000); the Wunstorf core in Germany, a representative section in the NW European pelagic shelf sea (Voigt et al., 2008); the Vocontian Basin, south east France (Western Tethys; Grosheny et al., 2006; Jarvis et al., 2011); and DSDP Site 530 (proto-South Atlantic; Forster et al., 2008).</text></s>

<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Based on the GSSP time scale, and confirmed by additional estimates from different OAE 2 sites, the duration of the C isotope excursion that characterizes the OAE 2 is between 500-600 kyr (Meyers et al., 2012b).</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In this study we investigate the Osi stratigraphy of multiple sections over an interval of ∼1.8 Myr from the late Cenomanian to the early Turonian and demonstrate that Osi values show some differences prior to OAE 2 depending on geographic location and depositional setting.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These variations are interpreted to reflect differential water mass exchange between epeiric settings and the open ocean modulated by sea-level change, as well as changes in terrigenous weathering rates due to enhanced global warming, which may have also affected nutrient fluxes and primary production levels.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These results suggest that epeiric seas, like the WIS or the European shelf sea, may have played an important role in the driving mechanism for OAE 2.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Additionally, we show that in comparison to the pre-OAE 2 interval, the syn-OAE 2 Osi values from Site 1260 and Furlo combined with Portland, Wunstorf, the Vocontian Basin and Site 530 are remarkably similar.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Coupled with the new geochronology from the WIS (Meyers et al., 2012a) a refined timing for the onset and duration of LIPs and its temporal association with OAE 2 is developed.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Furthermore, our interpretation of the Osi profile concurs with the hypothesis of increased ocean circulation based on analysis of neodymium (Nd) isotopes (Martin et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2013).</text></s>

Conclusions

<s sid="237"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res129" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>An influx of nutrients from the continents preconditioned the oceans and helped to trigger OAE 2 through increased productivity and, similarly to Jones and Jenkyns (2001), we infer that rising sea level may have been the tipping point for the development of widespread anoxia.</text></s>
<s sid="238"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res130" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The Osi profile at Portland suggests that the restriction of the epeiric WIS during the pre-OAE 2 interval amplified the affects of high weathering rates as abundant organic-rich sediments sequestered radiogenic Os derived from the ancient continental crust.</text></s>
