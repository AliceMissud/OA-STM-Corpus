Jovian magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling

<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Several studies, however, have made substantial progress in modelling this interaction (Hill, 1979; Pontius, 1997; Hill, 2001; Cowley and Bunce, 2001, 2003a,b; Nichols and Cowley, 2004; Cowley et al., 2005; Bougher et al., 2005; Cowley et al., 2007; Majeed et al., 2009; Tao et al., 2009; Ray et al., 2010; Nichols, 2011; Ray et al., 2012).</text></s>

<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj7" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Distribution of heat: the simulated thermospheric winds develop two main cells of meridional flow, which cool lower latitudes (≲75°) whilst heating the polar regions (≳80°).</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj8" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Yates et al. (2012) used the model of Smith and Aylward (2009) to study the influence of the solar wind on steady-state thermospheric flows of Jupiter.</text></s>

<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp1" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>Southwood and Kivelson (2001) suggested that a magnetospheric compression would cause an increase in the degree of magnetospheric plasma corotation (i.e. the quantity (ΩJ-ΩM) would decrease), and this would consequently lead to a sizeable decrease in M-I coupling currents and auroral emission.</text></s>

<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod3" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Negative flow shear also causes energy to be transferred from the magnetosphere to thermosphere; in contrast to the steady-state, where energy is transferred from the thermosphere to the magnetosphere, in order to accelerate outflowing, magnetospheric plasma towards corotation.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs3" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>For transient expansions, Cowley et al.

Magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling
In this section we discuss the effect of coupling the magnetosphere and ionosphere together.
The meridional electric field in the rest frame of the thermosphere may be written as(A.1)Eθ=Biρi(ΩT-ΩM),where Bi is the magnitude of the (assumed) radial ionospheric magnetic field (Bi=2BJ).
The combination of electric field, magnetic field and ion-neutral collisions causes Pedersen currents to flow in the ionosphere, mainly perpendicular to the direction of the planetary magnetic field.
These ionospheric currents form part of a larger current circuit which includes the radial current flowing in the magnetodisc and the FAC flowing along the magnetic field lines.
The height integrated Pedersen current density iP and its azimuthally integrated form IP(θi) are (Cowley et al., 2007; Smith and Aylward, 2009)(A.2)iP=ρiΣP(ΩT-ΩM)Bi,and(A.3)IP(θi)=2πρi2ΣP(ΩT-ΩM)Bi,where ΩT is a weighted average, computed over altitude, of the angular velocity of the thermosphere.
For a more detailed description of this the reader is referred to Yates et al. (2012) and Smith and Aylward (2009).
The height-integrated radial current density in the magnetodisc is denoted by iρ and can be obtained using Eq.
(A.2) under the assumption of current continuity (zero divergence of current density).
We have (Nichols and Cowley, 2004; Smith and Aylward, 2009)(A.4)ρeiρ=2ρiiP,(A.5)Iρ=8πΣPFe(ΩT-ΩM),where Iρ is the azimuthally integrated disc current.
The third and final component of our M-I current circuit is the FAC density.
j||i(θi) represents the FAC density at the ionospheric footpoint (at co-latitude θi) of the respective field lines.
This current density is obtained from the horizontal divergence of the Pedersen current:(A.6)j||i(θi)=-12πRi2sinθidIPdθi,where the sign of j||i(θi) indicates FAC direction (positive upward from planet).
Eq.
(A.6) corresponds to the northern hemisphere, where the magnetic field points radially outward (approximately, in auroral region) (Cowley et al., 2007).
The final aspect of M-I coupling we examine in this study is the energy transfer from planetary rotation to the thermosphere and magnetosphere.
The angular momentum transfer to the magnetosphere is used to accelerate magnetospheric plasma towards corotation whilst the energy dissipated within the thermosphere is used for heating and increasing kinetic energy.
The total power per unit area of the ionosphere transferred from planetary rotation P is the sum of atmospheric power PA and magnetospheric power PM dissipated per unit area (Hill, 2001).
As shown by Smith et al. (2005) atmospheric power consists of two components: (i) Joule heating PJ and (ii) ion drag power PD, some of may be viscously dissipated as heat.
These power relations are (Cowley et al., 2005)(A.7)P=ΩJτ,(A.8)PM=ΩMτ,(A.9)PA=(ΩJ-ΩM)τ,(A.10)PJ=(ΩT-ΩM)τ,(A.11)PD=(ΩJ-ΩT)τ,where(A.12)τ=ρiiPBirepresents the torque exerted by the J×B force per unit area of the ionosphere.
Auroral energies
Once FAC densities have been calculated, we can use the methods of Knight (1973) and Lundin and Sandahl (1978), as presented in Cowley et al. (2007), to calculate the enhanced precipitating electron energy flux Ef:(B.1)Ef=Ef02((j||ij||i0)2+1),where Ef0 is the unaccelerated electron energy flux, j||i0 is the unaccelerated FAC density (or the maximum current that can be carried by the electrons in the absence of field-aligned potential drops) and j||i is the upward (positive) FAC density calculated using Eq.
(A.6).
To enable a comparison with similar, earlier studies, we use the same electron population values described in Cowley et al. (2007), which are based on observations by Scudder et al. (1981) and Phillips et al. (1993a,b).
These parameters are presented in Table B1.
