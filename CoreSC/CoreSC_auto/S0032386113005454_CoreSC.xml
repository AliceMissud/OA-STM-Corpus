<s sid="2"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The glass transition temperature, Tg, of the cured unmodified epoxy polymer was 148 °C, and this was unchanged after the addition of the S-CSR particles.</text></s>

<s sid="5"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The addition of the S-CSR particles reduced the Young's modulus and tensile strength of the epoxy polymer, but at 20 °C the fracture energy, GIc, increased from 117 J/m2 for the unmodified epoxy to 947 J/m2 when 20 wt% of the S-CSR particles were incorporated.</text></s>
<s sid="6"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Fracture tests were also performed at -55 °C, -80 °C, and -109 °C.</text></s>

<s sid="8"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs4" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>For example, at -109 °C, a fracture energy of 481 J/m2 was measured using 20 wt% of S-CSR particles.</text></s>
<s sid="9"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res1" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Nevertheless, this value of toughness still represented a major increase compared with the unmodified epoxy polymer, which possessed a value of GIc of 174 J/m2 at this very low test temperature.</text></s>
<s sid="10"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thus, a clear fact that emerged was that the addition to the epoxy polymer of the S-CSR particles may indeed lead to significant toughening of the epoxy, even at temperatures as low as about -100 °C.</text></s>
<s sid="11"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj1" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The toughening mechanisms induced by the S-CSR particles were identified as (a) localised plastic shear-band yielding around the particles and (b) cavitation of the particles followed by plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer.</text></s>

<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Further, the experimental and modelling results of the present study indicated that the extent of plastic void growth was suppressed at low temperatures for the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers, but that the localised shear-band yielding mechanism was relatively insensitive to the test temperature.</text></s>

Introduction
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Epoxy polymers are a class of high-performance thermosetting polymers which are widely used for the matrices of fibre-reinforced composite materials and as adhesives.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>They are known for their excellent engineering properties, such as high modulus, low creep, high strength, and good thermal and dimensional stabilities.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, epoxy polymers have inherently low toughness and impact resistance due to their highly crosslinked structure.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This structure leads to brittle behaviour and causes the polymers to suffer from relatively poor resistance to crack initiation and growth.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>To improve the toughness of epoxy polymers, it has been established that the incorporation of a second micro-phase of a dispersed rubber, e.g.</text></s>

Ref.
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>[6-8], can increase the toughness.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Here the rubber or thermoplastic particles are typically about 0.1-5 μm in diameter with a volume fraction of about 5-20%.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The particles are typically well-dispersed, and formed by reaction-induced phase-separation.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>However, the particle size is difficult to control as it is dependent on the curing conditions, and hence cannot be varied systematically without changing the properties of the epoxy polymer.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>An alternative route to increase the toughness of epoxy polymers is to use core-shell rubber (CSR) particles.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs5" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>These particles comprise a soft rubbery core within a harder shell.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs6" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The particles are typically formed by emulsion polymerisation, and then dispersed in the epoxy resin.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res4" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Hence, it is readily possible to produce particles with a controlled particle size, unlike with phase-separating rubbers.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A range of core and shell materials may be used, and multilayer particles are common [9].</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod1" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The shell is chosen to be compatible with the epoxy polymer, and poly(methylmethacrylate), which is sometimes functionalised, is often used.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod2" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Typical core materials include polybutadiene [10] and acrylate-polyurethane rubbers [11].</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac19" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>They have been shown to increase the toughness of both bulk polymers and fibre composites, e.g.</text></s>

<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac20" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Hayes and Seferis [16] have reviewed the use of CSR particles in thermoset polymers and composites; this review also discusses some of the other properties that can be affected by the incorporation of CSR particles.</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj2" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>However, although the properties of these rubber-toughened epoxy polymers have been investigated extensively, only a few studies have reported the low-temperature performance of these rubber-toughened epoxies.</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In general, the literature [5,17-19] reports that the fracture toughness of rubber-toughened epoxy polymers decreases as the temperature decreases, except at very low temperatures (possibly having passed the β-transition of the polymer) where the fracture toughness appears to increase somewhat again.</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac21" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>It is generally accepted that the major toughening mechanism of rubber-toughened epoxies is based on a series of deformation processes, namely (a) localised plastic shear-band yielding around the rubber particles and (b) cavitation of the S-CSR particles followed by plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer.</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac22" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>It has been noted [1,3,5] that this second mechanism needs to be operative in order to typically achieve major increases in the toughness of the rubber-particle-modified epoxy polymer.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This suggests that using rubber particles with a relatively very low glass transition temperature, Tg, may enable cavitation of the rubber particles at very low test temperatures, and as a result allow plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer even at relatively low temperatures.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Hence, the present work used pre-formed polysiloxane core-shell rubber (S-CSR) particles which possess a relatively very low Tg of -100 °C to toughen an anhydride-cured epoxy polymer.</text></s>

Shear-band yielding

Summary
<s sid="236"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The toughening events of the S-CSR particle-modified epoxy polymers can be summarised as localised shear-banding of the epoxy polymer initiated by the particles and internal cavitation of the S-CSR particles (which relieves the triaxial stress-state in the vicinity of the crack tip) followed by void growth.</text></s>
<s sid="237"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These events contribute to the relatively high toughness measured from the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers.</text></s>
<s sid="238"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The differences observed at low temperatures indicate that the increase of the cavitational resistance of the S-CSR particles delays the cavitation process and enhances the localised shear-band yielding process.</text></s>
<s sid="239"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con25" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The increase of the yield stress of the epoxy polymer attenuates the deformation of the polymer and reduces the size of the deformation zone ahead of the crack tip, but this effect is compensated for by the increased energy absorption from the enhanced shear-band yielding.</text></s>
<s sid="240"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con26" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Hence, there is a reduction of the toughening performance of the S-CSR particles at low temperatures, but the competition between these effects results in the fracture energy being independent of the test temperature between -55 °C and -109 °C.</text></s>
Modelling studies
Introduction

<s sid="242"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res84" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Such mechanisms have been modelled by Hsieh et al. [33,49], based on the earlier Huang and Kinloch [50] model.</text></s>
<s sid="243"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res85" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This model has been found to accurately predict the fracture energy of particle-modified epoxy polymers.</text></s>
<s sid="244"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con27" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Hsieh et al. [33,49] proposed that the fracture energy can be expressed as(14)Gc=GCU+ψwhere GCU is the fracture energy of the unmodified epoxy.</text></s>
<s sid="245"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con28" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The toughening contribution of the S-CSR particles, ψ, is a combination of the two mechanisms of (i) plastic localised shear-band yielding, ΔGs, and (ii) plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer, ΔGv, as(15)ψ=ΔGs+ΔGv(It should be noted that the process of cavitation itself does not absorb a significant amount of energy, and so its contribution can be ignored.)</text></s>
<s sid="246"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con29" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Modelling of the ΔGs contribution</text></s>
<s sid="247"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod15" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The energy contribution from plastic shear-band yielding, ΔGs, initiated by the S-CSR particles is related to the size of the plastic zone [33,49] as(16)ΔGs=0.5VfσycγfF′(ry)where Vf is the volume fraction of S-CSR particles, σyc is the plane-strain compressive true yield stress, γf is the true fracture strain for the unmodified epoxy polymer, and F′(ry) is a geometric term that may be expressed as(17)F′(ry)=ry[(4π3Vfr)1/3(1-rpry)3-85(1-rpry)(rpry)52-1635(rpry)7/2-2(1-rpry)2+1635]</text></s>
<s sid="248"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod16" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The value of ry may be defined as(18)ry=Kvm2(1+μm31/2)2ryuwhere rp is the particle radius, Kvm is the maximum stress concentration factor of the von Mises stresses in the epoxy polymer, μm is a material constant which allows for the pressure-dependency of the yield stress and its value is taken as 0.2 [51].</text></s>
<s sid="249"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod17" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The value of Kvm is dependent on the volume fraction of particles, and was calculated by fitting to the data of Huang and Kinloch [39] who modelled rubber particles with a Poisson's ratio of 0.4999 in an epoxy polymer.</text></s>
<s sid="250"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod18" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The value of ryu, the Irwin prediction of the plane-strain plastic zone radius for the unmodified epoxy polymer at fracture, was calculated [52] using(19)ryu=16π(Kcuσyt)2where KCU is the fracture toughness and σyt is the tensile true yield stress of the unmodified epoxy.</text></s>
Modelling the ΔGv contribution
<s sid="251"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod19" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The contribution of ΔGv from the plastic void growth mechanism may be calculated [33] as(20)ΔGv=(1-μm23)(Vfv-Vfr)σycryuKvm2where μm is a material constant (see above), Vfv and Vfr are the volume fraction of voids and the volume fraction of S-CSR particles measured from the FEG-SEM and AFM micrographs, respectively.</text></s>
<s sid="252"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod20" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The value of ψ can now be calculated by combining Equations (16) and (20) into (15) to give(21)ψ=0.5VfσycγfF'(ry)+(1-μm23)(Vfu-Vfr)σycryuKvm2</text></s>
<s sid="253"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs35" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The material properties used for the modelling are given in Table 4.</text></s>
<s sid="254"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res86" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The main temperature-dependent terms which significantly affect the results of the proposed model are the plane-strain compressive true yield stress, σyc, and compressive true fracture strain, γf, the uniaxial tensile true yield stress, σyt, and the fracture energy, GCU, and fracture toughness, KCU, of the unmodified epoxy.</text></s>
<s sid="255"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs36" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The values for these parameters were experimentally measured as a function of the test temperature and their values are given in Tables 2 and 5.</text></s>
<s sid="256"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res87" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Examination of the fracture surfaces showed that 100% of the particles cavitated, and the mean void radius was measured.</text></s>
<s sid="257"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con30" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Hence, all the S-CSR particles were assumed to initiate shear-bands and to undergo cavitation with subsequent plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer.</text></s>
Application of the model
<s sid="258"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con31" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The values of the fracture energy of the S-CSR particle-modified epoxy polymers may be predicted over the range of temperatures concerned, and these predicted values are compared with the experimental results in Figs.</text></s>
<s sid="259"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con32" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>10 and 11 and Table 5.</text></s>
<s sid="260"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con33" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>As may be seen, the agreement is generally good over the complete range of test temperatures.</text></s>
<s sid="261"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con34" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Although, the Huang and Kinloch model tends to somewhat over-predict the fracture energy compared with the experimental results for the -55 °C and -80 °C temperature tests.</text></s>
<s sid="262"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con35" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This finding may be due to the over-estimation of the plastic deformation zone of the modified epoxies at these relatively low test temperatures.</text></s>
<s sid="263"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con36" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The individual contribution of the two toughening mechanisms to the total increase of the fracture energy of the modified epoxy polymers in the temperature range concerned may also be calculated by the above model, again see Table 5.</text></s>
<s sid="264"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con37" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Localised shear-banding was found to be the main toughening mechanism throughout the temperatures concerned in the present study.</text></s>
<s sid="265"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con38" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Indeed, over 60% of the toughness increase was from the localised shear-banding mechanism.</text></s>
<s sid="266"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con39" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Plastic void growth, following cavitation of the rubber particles, only contributed approximately 35% of the toughening effect at room temperature, and its contribution to the toughness decreased rapidly at low test temperatures, especially for the epoxy polymers containing relatively high concentrations of the S-CSR particles.</text></s>
<s sid="267"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con40" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This is due to the difficulty of initiating cavitation in the particles and the increase of the yield stress of the epoxy polymer, which greatly reduces the plastic deformability of the epoxy polymer, at low temperatures.</text></s>
Conclusions
<s sid="268"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con41" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>An epoxy resin cured with an anhydride was modified by the addition of polysiloxane core-shell rubber (S-CSR) particles.</text></s>
<s sid="269"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res88" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These rubber particles possessed a mean diameter of 0.18 μm and a glass transition temperature, Tg, of about -100 °C.</text></s>
<s sid="270"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res89" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>From atomic force microscopy studies, they were observed to be well-dispersed throughout the epoxy polymer.</text></s>
<s sid="271"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res90" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The glass transition temperature of the unmodified epoxy polymer was 148 °C.</text></s>
<s sid="272"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res91" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The addition of the S-CSR particles did not alter this value, but the elastic modulus and the yield stress of the epoxy were reduced in value.</text></s>
<s sid="273"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp50" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>The fracture energies of the S-CSR particle-modified epoxy polymers were measured at a range of temperatures from 20 °C to -109 °C.</text></s>
<s sid="274"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp51" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>At room temperature, a value of the fracture energy, GIc, of 117 J/m2 was measured for the unmodified epoxy.</text></s>
<s sid="275"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs37" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Addition of the S-CSR particles linearly increased the fracture energy, and a maximum value of 947 J/m2 was measured using 20 wt% of S-CSR particles at 20 °C.</text></s>
<s sid="276"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs38" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Further, the S-CSR particles significantly toughened the epoxy polymer even at cryogenic temperatures.</text></s>
<s sid="277"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs39" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>For example, a GIc value of 481 J/m2 was measured for the epoxy containing 20 wt% S-CSR particles at -109 °C.</text></s>
<s sid="278"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res92" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The toughening mechanisms of the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers were identified, and they were observed to be the same throughout the temperature range used.</text></s>
<s sid="279"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con42" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Firstly, plastic shear-band yielding, occurring as localised shear-bands, in the epoxy polymer were observed in the plastic deformation zone ahead of the crack tip in the transmission optical micrographs of the double-notched four-point bending tests.</text></s>
<s sid="280"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con43" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Secondly, the results of the atomic force microscopy and the scanning electron microscopy studies revealed that cavitation and subsequent plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer occurred.</text></s>
<s sid="281"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con44" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>A theoretical model was used to predict the toughness increment due to these two mechanisms over the entire temperature range.</text></s>
<s sid="282"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con45" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The predicted fracture energies were compared with the experimental data, and good agreement was found, which reinforces the suggested toughening micromechanisms which have been proposed.</text></s>
<s sid="283"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con46" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Further, as found previously [39,50], the model predicts that at the relatively low test temperatures the former micromechanism based upon plastic localised shear-band yielding in the epoxy polymer dominates, especially for the epoxy polymers containing relatively high concentrations of the S-CSR particles.</text></s>
<s sid="284"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con47" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This arises because, firstly, the S-CSR particles still act as points of stress concentration for such deformation to initiate, due to their lower modulus compared to the epoxy polymer over the complete temperate range.</text></s>
<s sid="285"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con48" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In contrast, secondly, at the relatively low test temperatures the S-CSR particles are now longer truly rubbery in nature and, therefore, cavitation of the particles, which then enables subsequent plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer, is significantly inhibited.</text></s>
<s sid="286"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con49" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Finally, a clear feature that emerges is that the addition to the epoxy polymer of the S-CSR particles with a mean diameter of 0.18 μm and a very low glass transition temperature, Tg, of about -100 °C may indeed lead to significant toughening of the epoxy, even at temperatures as low as about -100 °C.</text></s>
