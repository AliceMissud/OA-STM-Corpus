Discussion
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In this study, we induced DA neurons from monkey iPSCs by directed differentiation in vitro, and demonstrated that autologous transplantation of the iPSC-derived cells elicited only a minimal immune response in the nonhuman primate brain.</text></s>
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Previous reports have suggested that either autologous grafts of iPSC-derived neural cells (Emborg et al., 2013; Maria et al., 2013) or allogeneic grafts of fetal ventral mesencephalic cells (Redmond et al., 2008) can survive in a primate brain without immunosuppression.</text></s>
<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res27" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>None of these studies, however, directly compared the immunogenicity of autologous grafts with that of allogeneic ones.</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Our results clearly show differences in both immunogenicity and cell survival between these two types of grafts, and support the idea that immunosuppression is not necessary for autologous transplantation of iPSC-derived neural cells into the brain.</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con6" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The [11C]PK11195 PET study was useful for real-time visualization of this phenomenon.</text></s>
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con7" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Furthermore, this technique can also be applied to patients in the clinical setting, which would help to determine when and if immunosuppressive drugs can be withdrawn.</text></s>
<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs13" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Although we did not examine acute immune responses or inflammation within 48 hr, it is noteworthy that the responses were observed 2 or 3 months posttransplantation.</text></s>
<s sid="75"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res28" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In the case of iPSC-based transplantation, there are four possible mechanisms that can cause inflammatory and immune responses: (1) direct allorecognition of mismatched MHC or minor antigens of the donor cells, (2) indirect allorecognition through host-derived antigen-presenting cells, (3) expression of fetal antigens due to immature stem cells or remaining transgenes, and (4) mechanical damage rather than MHC mismatch.</text></s>
<s sid="76"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res29" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Because of the low expression level of MHC-I by the donor cells, direct allorecognition is unlikely to be the main cause.</text></s>
<s sid="77"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res30" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, donor-cell-derived astrocytes (Figure S4B), which can express both MHC-I and MHC-II to recruit T cells in response to IFN-γ (Akesson et al., 2009; Chastain et al., 2011), could be observed in the grafts.</text></s>
<s sid="78"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res31" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Furthermore, it takes a longer time for astrocytes to differentiate than neurons.</text></s>
<s sid="79"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con8" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Therefore, although there was no apparent expression of either MHC-I or MHC-II by the grafted GFP+ cells, donor-derived astrocytes may have contributed to the direct reaction in the late stage.</text></s>
<s sid="80"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con9" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Considering the high expression level of MHC-II by host-derived microglia in the allografts (Figures 3D-3G), indirect allorecognition seems to have played a major role in the present study.</text></s>
<s sid="81"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con10" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This requires the internalization and processing of the alloantigens, which are then recognized in peptidic form bound to recipient MHC-II molecules, possibly accounting for the late onset of the immune response.</text></s>
<s sid="82"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con11" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Autografts derived from iPSCs generated by retroviral vectors resulted in the accumulation of larger numbers of IBA1+ and CD45+ cells compared with those generated using episomal vectors, probably due to the residual expression of the transgenes (Figure S3).</text></s>
<s sid="83"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con12" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This indicates that residual transgenes can be immunogenic, and that it is therefore critical to use integration-free iPSCs.</text></s>
<s sid="84"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con13" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Mechanical damage caused by needle trauma can also activate host astrocytes and microglia to secrete proinflammatory cytokines, which recruit leukocytes.</text></s>

<s sid="86"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Another important finding is that, in spite of the immune responses mounted by the host brain, a substantial number of TH+ cells survived in the allografts.</text></s>

<s sid="92"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res33" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The in vivo studies revealed that the serum level of IFN-γ increased at 2 months, and CD45+ cells (including CD8+ cells) accumulated in the allografts 3.5-4 months after the transplant.</text></s>
<s sid="93"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res34" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>On the other hand, the levels of INF-γ in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in both the serum and CSF were below the limit of detection by ELISA (data not shown).</text></s>
<s sid="94"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res35" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>An immunofluorescence study did not reveal any apparent expression of MHC-I by the grafted cells (Figure S4A).</text></s>
<s sid="95"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Therefore, it is possible that the immune response in the primate brain was not strong enough to reject all of the donor cells.</text></s>
<s sid="96"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res36" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These findings closely correlate with the results of previous murine experiments (Hudson et al., 1994; Shinoda et al., 1995).</text></s>

<s sid="98"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res38" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The expression level was 1/100 compared with that of human peripheral blood cells in both hESCs and iPSCs, and it was similarly elevated in response to IFN-γ.</text></s>
<s sid="99"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res39" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It is difficult to precisely compare immunogenicity in monkeys with that in humans, but the low expression level of MHC-I by the donor cells may account for the mild rejection in both monkey and human neural transplantation.</text></s>
