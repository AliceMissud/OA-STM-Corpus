Introduction
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a cellular monolayer between the retina and the underlying choroidal vasculature.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The RPE participates actively in the visual process, notably by supporting the diurnal replenishment of the photoreceptors (Strauss, 2005).</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>RPE dysfunction significantly contributes to the pathophysiology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness (Lim et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>There are currently no disease-altering therapies available for the vast majority (over 85%) of AMD patients that suffer from the dry form of the disease, which is characterized by extracellular deposits termed drusen beneath the RPE and subsequent RPE atrophy in the macula.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The remaining approximately 15% of patients have wet AMD, in which neovascularization invades from the choroid; for these patients, repeated intravitreal injections with antiangiogenic drugs offer a highly effective, albeit palliative, treatment (Singer et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Replacement of dysfunctional submacular RPE with a cell-based therapeutic agent represents a potentially curative treatment strategy (Binder et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Some previous attempts in patients have been shown to improve vision, but most were limited by immune reactions, surgical complications, late-stage disease, or lack of an adequate RPE cell source (Stanzel and Holz, 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Translocation of an autologous patch of RPE/choroid remains clinically the most popular approach, because some patients benefit from the procedure, despite its high complication rates (van Zeeburg et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>With the development of RPE differentiation protocols from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Hirami et al., 2009; Klimanskaya et al., 2004), RPE transplantation has experienced a powerful renaissance, as scientists and clinicians envision an unlimited supply of RPE for transplantation.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac19" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, much is still not understood with regard to the physiology of stem-cell-derived RPE (Liao et al., 2010) and transplantation into patients is in the early stages.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac20" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Pilot data from a phase I/II trial (NCT01226628 and NCT01344993) with a suspension of hESC-derived RPE injected in patients with dry AMD or Stargardt's disease suggest a favorable safety profile and some limited improvement in vision (Schwartz et al., 2012); further dose-escalation in this multicenter study is on-going.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac21" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This is encouraging, given that prior studies using RPE cell suspensions showed they failed to survive or function on aged submacular Bruch's membrane (Sugino et al., 2011) and are more likely to be rejected than are RPE monolayers (Diniz et al., 2013).</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac22" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>A cultured human RPE monolayer that exhibits the physiology of its native counterpart could be a valuable alternative to an RPE-cell suspension.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac23" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This type of culture has been readily attained using fetal- or pluripotent-stem-cell-derived RPE.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac24" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, establishing such cultures from adult RPE has proven difficult and inconsistent, due to its propensity to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (reviewed in Burke, 2008).</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac25" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>We have optimized culture conditions that robustly activate a subpopulation of adult human RPE stem cells (RPESC), expand, and then differentiate them into highly pure RPE monolayers that exhibit physiological features of native RPE (Blenkinsop et al., 2013; Salero et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj6" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>This protocol allows us to explore the potential of adult RPESC-derived RPE for cell-replacement therapy.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>To date, we do not know which cell source will turn out to be therapeutically successful, and therefore, testing all potential candidates is important.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met1" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Using a cell source derived from the adult human RPE may possess several potential advantages, such as fewer ethical concerns compared to hESC and fetal human RPE (hRPE), the possibility of routine histocompatibility leukocyte antigen matching or even autologous transplantation (using a patient's own remaining healthy RPESCs) to minimize immunosuppression, reduced proliferative potential than hESCs or human iPSCs and therefore reduced tumorigenesis risk, and reduced threat of generating abnormal cell types.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>RPE monolayers grown on cell carriers would facilitate surgical handling and long-term functionality by substituting some or all of the functions of the aged Bruch's membrane (Binder et al., 2007).</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac26" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Coimplantation of differentiated RPE monolayers on a substrate has been attempted in animal models only in a few instances and with limited success (Bhatt et al., 1994; Diniz et al., 2013; Nicolini et al., 2000).</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot2" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Improvements would involve employing a biocompatible matrix that exhibits minimal deformation after transplantation, longer-term assessment postsurgery, and use of a large-eyed animal model for better assessment of surgical technique.</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj7" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>We have previously reported on a method and instrumentation to deliver ultrathin rigid-elastic cell carriers (polyester [PET]) into the subretinal space (SRS) of rabbits (Stanzel et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj8" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Here, we demonstrate this technology can be used to deliver monolayers of human RPE on permeable polyester carriers into the SRS of the rabbit.</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj9" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Notably, we find RPE isolated from adult cadaver donors can expand 20-fold and survive as a polarized RPE monolayer for 1 month after transplantation, therefore representing a clinically relevant RPE cell source.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj10" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Transplants were followed with state-of-the-art ophthalmic imaging technology, including spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), confocal scanning-laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO), color funduscopic photography, and histology.</text></s>

Full Implantation Movie with Fetal hRPE/PET Implant
(1) An enlarged opening in the retina (retinotomy) is created with vertical scissors.
(2) The implant is inserted with a custom-made instrument from epiretinal underneath the retina.
(3) The implant is pushed further into the subretinal space with half-closed branches of 23G scissors.
(4) Final positioning of the graft is achieved with a 41G Teflon-cannula.
