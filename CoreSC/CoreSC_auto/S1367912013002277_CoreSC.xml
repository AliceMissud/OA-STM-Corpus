Introduction
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Enhanced concentrations of terrigenous elements such as: Al, Si, Fe, K, and Ti have been interpreted as representing increased supply of siliciclastic materials of fluvial or aeolian origin in marine or lacustrine sediments (Goldberg and Arrhenius, 1958; Arz et al., 1998; Jansen et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2010, 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Al and Ti are considered extremely resistant to weathering and well conserved elements (Nesbitt and Markovics, 1997; Wei et al., 2003).</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Besides, they are generally used to estimate the abundance of terrigenous materials in sedimentary environments (Murray and Leinen, 1996; Klump et al., 2000).</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These two elements can resist chemical weathering processes (Nesbitt and Young, 1982; Nesbitt and Markovics, 1997); therefore, when considering transportation processes, the Ti/Al ratio is worth experimenting with to help trace density differences in siliciclastic materials derived from fluvial and aeolian sources.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Among the terrigenous elements mentioned above Si, Fe, and K are not necessarily good indicators of sedimentary terrigenous origins.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For example, Si content in marine or lacustrine sediments is often influenced by biogenic opal such as diatoms or radiolaria (Mackin and Aller, 1984).</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The element Fe may also reflect authigenic precipitation from Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and pyrite under redox conditions (Mangini et al., 1990; Dymond et al., 1992).</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Finally, the element K in siliciclastic materials is mainly bonded to illite and potassium feldspar (Yarincik et al., 2000; Zabel et al., 2001), but it is also a major cation in seawater (Bruland, 1983).</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Moreover, K content declines during potassium feldspar alteration (Nesbitt and Young, 1982).</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con3" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Therefore, we suggest that Ti and Al can be used as efficient indicators of transportation energy changes by their different elementary gravity.</text></s>

<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In paleoclimate research, variations in grain size are often used as an indicator of aeolian signals in the Loess Plateau (Pye and Zhou, 1989; Xiao et al., 1999; An, 2000), or the intensive coarse grain can be regarded as the flooding events in deposited environments.</text></s>
