Introduction
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Soil represents a temporary reservoir for phosphorus (P) in which its availability affects plant growth and biological processes (Lair et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Soil phosphorus (P) is an essential element for plant growth but is often slowly available to plants within the soil environment.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This is mainly due to soil P being sorbed to the soil reactive clay surfaces, Al and Fe oxides, carbonates, organic matter.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The soil pH then determines the chemical complexion of P (Torrent, 1997; Borggaard et al., 2004).</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>At a soil pH above 5.5 most soil phosphate reacts with calcium and at a pH below 5.5 it will react with Al and Fe oxides leaving P only slowly available to plants.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Historically crop production did rely on natural availabilities of soil phosphorus (P) and input from organic manure.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However with the increased food demand, improved agrotechnology and availability of mineral P forms in the 20th and 21st centuries, fertilizer P application became the substantial source of soil P (Cordell et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In developed countries P accumulation took place in the past decades, due to high doses of P fertilization (Lemercier et al., 2008).</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Although the impact of P input to soils had a positive impact on crop production the impact on the environment such as eutrophication has become a problem within Europe (Csathó et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Additionally the world's P supply is both finite and non-renewable (Jordan-Meille et al., 2012) which has caused tension within global P markets (IFA, 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Hence, P fertilizer usage must be carried out to secure a sustainable environment and best possible utilization by crops.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>To meet these challenges fertilizers recommendations to farmers become a common practice worldwide generally optimizing fertilizer doses to sustain a desired yield without a load to the environment.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj4" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Consequently, soil P recommendation systems are widely used around the world to ensure good soil management and nutrient efficiency promoting agricultural sustainability.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However recommendation systems differ considerably among countries.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Not many systems can be found as peer reviewed literature; however a brief overview on those available is hereby given.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Phosphorus recommendation systems are commonly used in Brazil, in a country where soils are generally nutrient poor.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The Brazilian recommendation systems are based on quantitative analyses of soil input variables.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The input variable consists of the following factors; cation exchange capacity (CEC), base saturation (BS), base sum, exchangeable aluminium (Al), calcium/magnesium (Ca/Mg), potassium (K) and P levels, sodium (Na) saturation and electrical conductivity.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The output variable of the system is the amount of fertilizer to be applied.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac19" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This is mainly based on 4 classes, low, medium, high to very high (Palhares et al., 2001).</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac20" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>While Brazil follows a detailed set of variables when recommending P fertilizer levels, the agronomists at Kansas University - who, among other land grant Universities in the United States, provide single rate recommendation for nutrients such as P - are developing a fertilizer recommendation system that gives growers the flexibility to choose a soil management practice suitable for their needs.</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met6" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This flexibility included choosing from 2 systems, the &quot;nutrient sufficiency recommendation system&quot; which is developed to provide a 90-95% maximum yield for the year, and the &quot;build maintenance fertility program&quot; based soil test values over a planned period of time, usually 4-8 years, for both immediate crop needs and build up levels to a non-limiting value (Leikam et al., 2003).</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met7" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In West Africa, a framework to optimize soil fertility management in rice production is in use were the yield potential is estimated by an ecophysiological model based on weather conditions, cultivar species and sowing date.</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met8" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>This yield potential is used as an input into a static model together with field specific data such as recovery efficiency of applied N, P and K, indigenous NPK supply and maximum NPK accumulation.</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met9" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Outputs of the framework include, required fertilizer doses to obtain different yield targets depending on yield potential and the soil nutrient supply (Haefele et al., 2003).</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met10" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Sims (1992) conducted a study assessing different P tests for fertilizer recommendations used in Europe and confirmed their effectiveness.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met11" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The amount of P extracted did however differ, with different extraction methods.</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met12" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Jordan-Meille et al. (2012) published an overview of fertilizer P recommendation systems in Europe where fertilizer recommendation systems from 18 countries were compared were data on different fertilization systems was obtained from the peer reviewed literature, personal contact and the &quot;grey literature&quot;.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met13" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In Europe P recommendation systems are mainly based on 3 steps.</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met14" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The first step includes soil testing to approximate the crop available P pool in soil.</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met15" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The second test involves relating results from the before mentioned soil tests to yield response (correlations between soil P tests and field trials) to account, similarly to already mentioned Brazilian system, for a 90% maximum yield per year.</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met16" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Based on these results, threshold values are often developed to divide soils into 3 different categories, &quot;low&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;high&quot; and sometimes &quot;excessive&quot;.</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met17" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>From these categories the third step takes place, that is, the actual P recommendation is calculated.</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met18" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>According to the review conducted by Jordan-Meille et al. (2012), the main difference between P recommendation systems in European countries was the chemical method used to extract P during the soil P test.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met19" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Some use strong extractants which dissolved strongly bound P and hence does not necessarily represent the actual labile pool of P in soils and others use week extractants like water or week acids which might underestimate available soil P (Neyroud and Lischer, 2003).</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met20" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Moreover about half of the recommendation systems used in Europe take into account other factors such as crop characteristic (Belgium, Hungary, Sweden, Denmark, England, France, Germany and Switzerland) and soil characteristics such as soil texture, clay and organic matter content, soil pH, carbonate content and soil type (France, Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands) (Jordan-Meille et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met21" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In the frame of the Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS, Eurostat, 2013a) sampling of topsoil (upper 20cm) was carried out on around 22,000 points in 25 EU Member States in 2009 (Tóth et al., 2013a) and in other 2 Member States - Bulgaria and Romania - in 2012 (Tóth et al., 2013c).</text></s>
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met22" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Beside other basic soil properties soil nutrient (N, P, K) content of these samples were measured in a single laboratory using standard determination method (ISO, 1994) which is based on the method of Olsen et al. (1954).</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met23" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Results of the LUCAS topsoil survey and laboratory analysis allows an assessment of nutrient status of croplands at a European scale.</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met24" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>As no coherent figures from EU Member States were available to date - mainly due to data accessibility problems or lack of data - the LUCAS topsoil survey provides a unique opportunity for a European overview of this issue.</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met25" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The LUCAS topsoil P data can help to refine and update incomplete or outdated national spatial phosphorus datasets or just provide an independent set of data for cross-comparison for countries where soil P data is available, such as the UK (Emmett et al., 2010) or France (Huyghe, 2013).</text></s>
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa3" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The aim of our current study was to make a comparative assessment of plant-available phosphorus levels of croplands in regions of the European Union using the data from the LUCAS topsoil survey.</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met26" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Plant available phosphorus levels were determined using two selected fertilizer recommendation systems: one from Hungary (Antal et al., 1979) one from the United Kingdom (DEFRA, 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met27" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>These two systems were chosen as they are developed for two contrasting agro-ecologic regions of Europe, did not include site specific criteria which were not adaptable in other parts of the EU and hence were easily applicable to a large Pan European dataset such as the hereby presented LUCAS soil dataset.</text></s>
<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met28" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Further to the determination and comparison of plant available phosphorus levels we made an attempt for a general estimation of P demand of croplands in the European Union, based on yield statistics and the data from the LUCAS topsoil survey.</text></s>

<s sid="216"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Fertilizer doses have to be based on attainable yield and soil nutrient levels.</text></s>
<s sid="217"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The recent EU-wide LUCAS topsoil survey provided the opportunity to have reliable comparison of P levels in soils of the EU.</text></s>
<s sid="218"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Based on measured values from uniform soil tests we provided first time reliable figures of P levels in soils of the EU, also in relation to cropping needs.</text></s>
<s sid="219"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con25" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Based on these figures there are considerable differences within the Union; higher P levels can be observed in regions where higher crop yields can be expected (North-West Europe) due to favourable climatic conditions.</text></s>
<s sid="220"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con26" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>On the other hand, higher P levels are measured in the regions where high fertilizer P inputs are reported and where probably the livestock densities are higher too.</text></s>
<s sid="221"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con27" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We made an effort to estimate the P input need of European croplands, and found disparities of calculated input need and reported fertilizer statistics both on local (country) scale and on EU level.</text></s>
<s sid="222"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con28" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>However further studies are needed to arrive to exact figures on a continental scale.</text></s>
<s sid="223"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con29" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This might be achieved by the regionalization of the analysis using regional or national fertilizer recommendation systems and with the application of crop-nutrient balance models.</text></s>
<s sid="224"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con30" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Such an analysis is currently hindered by the non-existence or non-accessibility of recommendation system for many regions and the lack of statistics on crop yields within regions.</text></s>
<s sid="225"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con31" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Nevertheless, the first ever uniform topsoil P survey of the EU highlights the contradictions between soil P management of different countries of the Union while also highlights the inconsistencies between reported P fertilizer consumption and advised P doses.</text></s>
<s sid="226"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con32" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Our findings also underline the need to improve statistics on fertilizer use and crop yields in the EU towards finer scale information.</text></s>
<s sid="227"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con33" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We can assume that with the availability of more accurate information on crop yields and fertilizer input - including both mineral and organic P inputs - a coherent framework of soil P management can be worked out for the EU.</text></s>
<s sid="228"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con34" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Our analysis shows a status of a baseline period with data from the years 2009 and 2012, while a repeated LUCAS topsoil survey can be a useful tool to monitor future changes of nutrient levels, including P in soils of the EU.</text></s>
