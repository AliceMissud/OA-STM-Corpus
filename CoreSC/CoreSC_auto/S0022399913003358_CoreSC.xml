<TITLE>The prevalence of tinnitus and the relationship with neuroticism in a middle-aged UK population
</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>

Abstract
Background
<s sid="1"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res1" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Previous research has suggested that a substantial proportion of the population are severely affected by tinnitus, however recent population data are lacking.</text></s>
<s sid="2"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res2" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Furthermore, there is growing evidence that the perception of severity is closely related to personality factors such as neuroticism.</text></s>
Objective
<s sid="3"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>In a subset (N=172,621) of a large population sample of &gt;500,000 adults aged 40 to 69years, (from the UK Biobank dataset) we calculated the prevalence of tinnitus and that which is perceived as bothersome, and examined the association between tinnitus and a putative predisposing personality factor, neuroticism.</text></s>
Method
<s sid="4"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Participants were recruited through National Health Service registers and aimed to be inclusive and as representative of the UK population as possible.</text></s>
<s sid="5"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa3" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The assessment included subjective questions concerning hearing and tinnitus.</text></s>
<s sid="6"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp1" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>Neuroticism was self-rated on 13 questions from the Eysenck Personality Inventory.</text></s>
<s sid="7"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp2" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>Associations between neuroticism and tinnitus were tested with logistic regression analyses.</text></s>
Results
<s sid="8"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Prevalence of tinnitus was significantly higher for males, and increased with age, doubling between the youngest and oldest age groups (males 13% and 26%; females 9% and 19% respectively).</text></s>
<s sid="9"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res4" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Of those with tinnitus, females were more likely to report bothersome tinnitus.</text></s>
<s sid="10"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Neuroticism was associated with current tinnitus and bothersome tinnitus, with the items: 'loneliness', 'mood swings', 'worrier/anxious' and 'miserableness', as the strongest associations of bothersome tinnitus.</text></s>
Conclusions
<s sid="11"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Neuroticism was identified as a novel association with tinnitus.</text></s>
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Individuals with tinnitus and higher levels of neuroticism are more likely to experience bothersome tinnitus, possibly as a reflection of greater sensitivity to intrusive experiences.</text></s>

Introduction
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Tinnitus is the perception of sounds in the head or ears, usually defined as a ringing, buzzing or whistling sound.</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Tinnitus can be objective or subjective.</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met1" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Objective tinnitus is caused by sounds generated by an internal biological activity.</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, subjective tinnitus is much more common and results from abnormal neural activities which are not formed by sounds [1].</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Subjective tinnitus is a common and disturbing phenomenon, with a reported prevalence ranging from 7 to 20% [2-5] in the general population, and an estimated 10year incidence rate in adults aged over 48years of 13% [6].</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Approximately 5% of the population is severely affected by their tinnitus [7], for example experiencing sleep disorders, concentration difficulties, and symptoms of anxiety and depression.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Tinnitus can affect a person's satisfaction with quality of life [8], and their physical, emotional, and social functioning [9], as well as leading to a higher incidence of anxiety and depression [10].</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, not everyone with tinnitus will experience the same amount of distress and impairment of quality of life.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp1" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>It is likely that psychological factors - including personality characteristics - mediate the impact of tinnitus.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod1" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Personality type can influence the vulnerability to, and the severity of, the problem by influencing the tendency to be aware of it [11].</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod2" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Personality characteristics previously reported to be associated with tinnitus include hysteria and hypochondriasis [9,12], introversion [13], withdrawal [9], and emotional isolation [14].</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod3" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Additionally, particular cognitive strategies, for example, dysfunctional and catastrophic thoughts can increase patients' emotional distress and perceived tinnitus severity, and are thought to be closely related to personality factors [15].</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod4" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Neuroticism is expressed as &quot;individual differences in the tendency to experience negative, distressing emotions&quot; [16] (p.</text></s>
301).
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod5" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>At one extreme, individuals are characterized by high levels of vulnerability to experience negative emotions, including sadness, fear, anxiety, anger, frustration, and insecurity [17].</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>At the other end of the spectrum, individuals who score low in neuroticism are more emotionally stable and less reactive to stress.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Neuroticism has been associated with adverse outcomes in various health conditions, including increased likelihood of morbidity in those with testicular cancer [18], and an increased likelihood of arthritis, kidney/liver disease, and diabetes in the general population [19].</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>There is evidence that neurotic traits are stronger in tinnitus patients [20], particularly in those with higher levels of tinnitus annoyance, and recent evidence that neuroticism may predict the development of severe tinnitus in patients already experiencing some tinnitus [21].</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In a cross-sectional sample of 530 participants (50% with chronic tinnitus), Bartels and colleagues [22] studied the role of type D personality (the tendency towards negative affectivity and social inhibition) on health-related quality of life and self-reported tinnitus-related distress.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Tinnitus patients with type D personality reported greater tinnitus-related distress and poorer health-related quality of life compared to those with other personality types.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The authors concluded that some personality characteristics are associated with having tinnitus and are likely to contribute to its perceived severity.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>UK prevalence estimates for tinnitus are relatively dated; data for the widely cited National Study of Hearing (NSH) [2] were collected in the 1980's.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp2" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>It is possible that prevalence figures may have changed since then, for example, due to more recreational noise exposure.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In addition, neither the NSH nor any other large-scale, population-based study has provided comparisons between tinnitus and neuroticism.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa4" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The objectives of this study were to provide a detailed description of the prevalence of tinnitus in a large population study of UK adults aged 40 to 69years, according to age and sex, (following on from a previous study [5]), as well as to examine the link between tinnitus severity and neuroticism.</text></s>
Methods
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa5" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The UK Biobank is a large dataset which was established as a resource for the investigation of the genetic, environmental and lifestyle causes of common diseases [23].</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa6" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>It provides an excellent opportunity to study a range of factors associated with hearing-related problems, including tinnitus.</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa7" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Recruitment of adults aged 40 to 69years was carried out through National Health Service registers and aimed to be inclusive and as representative as possible of the UK population.</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Overall, 9.2million invitations were sent out and 503,325 participants were recruited over the course of 2006-2010, giving a response rate of 5.47%.</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp3" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>It is possible that the low response rate may have led to unknown biases; however, due to the size and coverage of the sample, UK Biobank suggests that associations observed in the sample should be generalizable to the UK population [23].</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Participants completed a single assessment of approximately 90minute duration at one of the 22 assessment centres located in England, Scotland, and Wales.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs3" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The UK Biobank self-completed touch-screen questionnaire included data relating to a broad range of health-related issues, including hearing, lifestyle, occupation, family history, and psychological state.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj1" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The present study reports data related to tinnitus and personality.</text></s>
Demographic questions
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp3" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>Demographic data were collected during the assessment, including age, sex and socioeconomic status.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp4" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>The Townsend deprivation score was used in UK Biobank as a proxy for socioeconomic status.</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp5" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>This is a geographic based measure where census data are available and were used as a measure of deprivation using the 2001 census returns.</text></s>
Tinnitus
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp6" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>Two self-report questions on tinnitus were included in the touchscreen questionnaire, answered by 172,621 participants.</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp7" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>The first question was &quot;Do you get or have you had noises (such as ringing or buzzing) in your head or in one or both ears that lasts for more than five minutes at a time?&quot; Participants who gave a yes response were then asked to categorise the duration from a predefined list.</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Current tinnitus was identified if the participant responded: 'Yes, now most or all of the time', 'Yes, now a lot of the time' or 'Yes, now some of the time'.</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The second question was concerned with severity of tinnitus: &quot;How much do these noises worry, annoy or upset you when they are at their worst?&quot; The response options were 'not at all', 'slightly', 'moderately', or 'severely'.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Bothersome tinnitus was defined as those who responded 'severely' or 'moderately'.</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Participants could also respond 'do not know' or 'prefer not to answer' to these questions.</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res21" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The UK Biobank assessment protocol did not include any tinnitus scale, nor did it measure the loudness of the tinnitus, however the subjective questions included have been deemed reliable in similar studies [2].</text></s>
Hearing difficulty
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res22" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Participants (n=497,984) were asked &quot;Do you have any difficulty with your hearing?&quot; Participants could respond 'yes', 'no', or 'I am completely deaf'.</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res23" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Those that responded 'I am completely deaf' were excluded from answering subsequent hearing-related questions.</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res24" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A second question asked: &quot;Do you find it difficult to follow a conversation if there is background noise (such as TV, radio, children playing)?&quot; Again, participants could respond 'yes', or 'no'.</text></s>
Neuroticism

<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res29" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The response options were: 'yes', 'no', 'do not know', 'prefer not to answer'.</text></s>
<s sid="63"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res30" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These variables were combined to create an overall measure of 'neuroticism' on a continuous scale, as per the EPI scoring protocol, i.e. a score of 13 would indicate responding 'yes' to all 13 questions.</text></s>

Analysis
<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Analysis was conducted in three phases.</text></s>
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met3" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>First of all, prevalence rates of tinnitus and bothersome tinnitus were obtained for males and females separately.</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met4" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Overall prevalence rates were age-standardised by reference to the 40-69year old age profile from the 2011 UK census; they were also standardised for deprivation using the Townsend index.</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met5" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Standardisation of the national deciles of the Townsend score means that the range from 0 to 1 corresponds to the range from the least deprived to the most deprived.</text></s>
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met6" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The neuroticism score was similarly scaled to range between 0 and 1, by division of 13, to facilitate comparison with other effects.</text></s>
<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa8" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Further analyses were performed using binary logistic regression to examine whether neuroticism is associated with tinnitus and tinnitus severity, while controlling for demographic factors (age, sex, deprivation) and hearing difficulty.</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp8" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>All analyses were conducted in R using the mice package for multiple imputation [25].</text></s>

<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp10" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>A subsequent, conditional binary logistic multiple regression analysis was performed based on all participants with current tinnitus, with severity (tinnitus not bothersome as the reference category) as the dependent variable.</text></s>
<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp11" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>In both cases, age, sex, hearing difficulty, hearing difficulty in background noise, deprivation, and neuroticism were the predictor variables.</text></s>
<s sid="75"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp12" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>For all questions, participants had the option of choosing 'do not know' or 'prefer not to answer'.</text></s>
<s sid="76"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp13" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>Questions relating to hearing, including the two questions regarding tinnitus, were introduced at a later stage than other questions.</text></s>
<s sid="77"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp14" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>For example, all participants (n=501,776) were asked the personality questions but approximately one third of participants (n=172,621) were asked the questions relating to tinnitus.</text></s>
<s sid="78"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res32" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Only this subset of participants was included in the analysis.</text></s>
<s sid="79"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con3" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Inspection of patterns of missing data due to participants choosing not to respond to particular questions suggested that data were not Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) but that missing data might be in some way informative.</text></s>
<s sid="80"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp15" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>Missing responses for each of the individual personality type questions ranged from 1.9% to 4.9%.</text></s>

Discussion
<s sid="107"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>This study reports the prevalence of tinnitus in a large population sample, while further exploring the link between tinnitus severity and neuroticism (previously only examined in clinical studies).</text></s>

<s sid="110"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>As neuroticism is a stable personality trait [28] it is unlikely to develop as a result of experiencing tinnitus.</text></s>
<s sid="111"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con6" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is more likely that those who are more neurotic and experience tinnitus are more likely to perceive the tinnitus as being bothersome, compared to those who are less neurotic.</text></s>
<s sid="112"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con7" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These findings do suggest that tinnitus patients with higher levels of neuroticism may be more prone to distress and consequently more severe tinnitus.</text></s>
<s sid="113"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con8" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Loneliness was the most significant association with bothersome tinnitus which supports previous research showing that tinnitus sufferers are likely to experience loneliness [29], possibly as a result of withdrawing from social interactions [9] and thereby increasing feelings of isolation and loneliness.</text></s>
<s sid="114"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res52" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Tyler and Baker [30] found that over a third (36.1%) of tinnitus patients reported emotional problems such as despair, frustration and depression, while nearly a fifth (16.6%) reported insecurity, fear and worry.</text></s>
<s sid="115"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res53" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Furthermore, clinical studies have also shown higher rates of anxiety and depression among tinnitus patients compared with those without tinnitus [31], which supports the finding that 'mood swings', 'worrier/anxious' and 'miserableness' were significant associations of bothersome tinnitus in the current study.</text></s>
<s sid="116"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con9" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The present study further expands on our earlier work [5] by providing a more detailed breakdown of tinnitus prevalence according to age and sex.</text></s>

<s sid="118"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res55" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Other epidemiological studies, the Blue Mountains Hearing Study [32] and the Beaver Dam study [4], reported prevalence rates of tinnitus of 30% and 10.6% respectively, although the former included past tinnitus as well as current tinnitus.</text></s>
<s sid="119"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res56" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The Beaver Dam study also found that tinnitus was higher for males than for females (11.9% vs 9.4%), and noted increasing trends in prevalence by age group for men, women and both sexes, consistent with the pattern found in the present study.</text></s>
<s sid="120"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res57" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In the present study, 3.8% of current tinnitus sufferers reported bothersome tinnitus.</text></s>
<s sid="121"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con10" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Even though males were more likely to report tinnitus, females were more likely to be bothered by their tinnitus.</text></s>
<s sid="122"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con11" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This accords with previous research showing that female sex is a risk factor for bothersome tinnitus [33,34].</text></s>
<s sid="123"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con12" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The under-reporting of bothersome tinnitus in men may be partly explained by a tendency for men to deny or play down the severity of the symptoms of ill health [35].</text></s>
<s sid="124"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con13" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Self-reported hearing difficulty was the strongest association with tinnitus.</text></s>
<s sid="125"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con14" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Previous research has shown that around 40% of 55-74year olds with hearing difficulties also report tinnitus [36], and the majority of tinnitus patients have some degree of hearing loss [37].</text></s>
<s sid="126"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>No single theory explaining the cause of tinnitus is universally accepted, but one theory suggests that tinnitus may result from an increase of central gain (to compensate for deprived sensory inputs) which amplifies neural noise in order to maintain neural homeostasis [38].</text></s>
<s sid="127"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con16" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is likely that the severity of tinnitus is influenced by a complex interaction involving auditory, psychological and emotional networks [39,40].</text></s>
<s sid="128"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con17" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is interesting that neuroticism is a strong association with current tinnitus, albeit not as strong as hearing difficulty.</text></s>
<s sid="129"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con18" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Furthermore, of those who have tinnitus, neuroticism has a stronger effect on the perceived severity than hearing difficulty.</text></s>
<s sid="130"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con19" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>One explanation could be that those who are more neurotic may think their tinnitus is indicative of a more serious condition and therefore find the tinnitus more bothersome.</text></s>
<s sid="131"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con20" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The finding that personality traits such as neuroticism can contribute to tinnitus awareness and distress is important when considering treatment approaches because personality traits are generally stable over time [41], although the absolute level of personality traits can change [42].</text></s>
<s sid="132"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con21" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thus it is possible that psychological interventions may be beneficial for tinnitus patients although the effects may be gradual [11].</text></s>
<s sid="133"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The primary limitation of these analyses was that the UK Biobank test protocol did not include a validated tinnitus questionnaire.</text></s>
<s sid="134"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con23" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>More detailed data on lateralization, pitch, and loudness of the tinnitus may be informative as previous research suggested that the level of intrusiveness is moderated by the specific quality or type of tinnitus (e.g. fluctuating versus non-fluctuating) [43].</text></s>
<s sid="135"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con24" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Furthermore, no information was available on the duration that the participant experienced tinnitus.</text></s>
<s sid="136"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con25" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is possible that long-term tinnitus sufferers may develop successful coping strategies and are better able to manage their condition, whereas those who have had tinnitus for a relatively short duration may not have learned coping strategies and thus are more bothered by tinnitus [43].</text></s>
<s sid="137"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con26" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Although such data would be desirable for better characterisation of tinnitus, a full tinnitus questionnaire would not have been practical to administer within the crowded UK Biobank assessment protocol.</text></s>
Conclusion
<s sid="138"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con27" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Analysing data from a large population of UK adults, we have shown that the prevalence of tinnitus increases with age, and that a high proportion of sufferers report tinnitus as being moderately or severely bothersome, although age was not related to the perceived severity of tinnitus.</text></s>
<s sid="139"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con28" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Women were especially likely to report bothersome tinnitus.</text></s>
<s sid="140"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con29" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This study confirms previous research suggesting that hearing loss is a strong predictor of tinnitus, but we have also shown that personality factors identified as neuroticism are associated with the experience of tinnitus, particularly in those reporting that their tinnitus is severe.</text></s>
<s sid="141"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con30" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Although causality cannot be determined, the study supports an interpretation that otherwise stable personality factors and mood influence the ways in which tinnitus is experienced and managed.</text></s>
<s sid="142"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con31" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>From a clinical management point of view, clinicians would benefit from an understanding that tinnitus severity is a very complex interaction involving auditory, psychological and emotional networks.</text></s>
<s sid="143"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con32" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Long-term psychological approaches may be effective in helping tinnitus sufferers.</text></s>
