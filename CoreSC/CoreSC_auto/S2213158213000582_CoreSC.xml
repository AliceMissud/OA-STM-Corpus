Introduction
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), a now large number of studies show smaller 100ms auditory amplitudes in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) than healthy controls (HC).</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In a review of studies examining N1 and M100 in schizophrenia, Rosburg et al. (2008) concluded that 100ms auditory abnormalities are most commonly observed in studies using interstimulus intervals greater than 1s and that an increase in N1 amplitude by allocation of attention is often lacking in individuals with SZ.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Several large-sample studies provide examples.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met1" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Examining N1 activity in the standard paired-click paradigm, Turetsky et al. (2008) observed a small first and a normal second N1 click response in SZ (N=142) relative to HC (N=221).</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Reduced N1 was also observed in the unaffected first-degree relatives of individuals with SZ without co-morbid psychiatric or substance use conditions, and N1 amplitude was observed to be a heritable measure and a better endophenotype than N1 gating.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj7" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>In another recent large-N study, Smith et al. (2010) used simultaneous EEG and MEG to examine 100ms auditory processes in individuals with SZ (N=79) and HC (N=73) during a paired-click task.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Patients had larger N1 Cz and left and right superior temporal gyrus (STG) M100 ratio scores (second-click/first-click), with EEG and MEG ratio score group differences due to a smaller first click (S1) response in patients, suggesting a deficit in encoding auditory information rather than a deficit in filtering redundant information.</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>N1 (EEG) and M100 (MEG) are the most prominent deflections of the adult auditory event-related potential (ERP) or field (ERF) (Hari, 1990).</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In an early study, Naatanen and Picton (1987) argued that the electric N1 reflects contributions from up to 6 distinct cortical areas: dipoles in or near the primary auditory cortex as well as prefrontal cortex (PFC) sources.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Later studies showed connections between STG and PFC.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For example, several studies have demonstrated bidirectional connections between STG and PFC in the rhesus monkey (Knight et al., 1999).</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Combined tracing and immunohistochemistry studies have revealed that projections from PFC pyramidal neurons make synaptic contact with a subset of calbindin-positive GABAergic interneurons in auditory areas (Barbas et al., 2005).</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Through these connections, PFC pyramidal neurons may modulate the excitability of microcircuits within the monkey's auditory belt and parabelt (Barbas et al., 2005).</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Neural tracers infused into auditory cortex have also been found to emerge in PFC axonal terminal (Romanski, 2004; Romanski et al., 1999).</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Finally, anatomical studies in humans have identified white-matter tracks connecting auditory cortex with lateral and medial PFC.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These observations have been corroborated via in vivo imaging (Catani et al., 2002).</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Taken together, monkey and human studies support the hypothesis that PFC pyramidal neurons modulate the flow of information in auditory cortices by controlling the activity of GABAergic interneurons, which in turn modulate the excitability of STG pyramidal neurons (Barbas et al., 2005).</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac17" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>With regard to individuals with SZ, there is evidence of aberrant fronto-temporal connectivity: in a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study, Abdul-Rahman et al. (2012) showed that disruption of fronto-temporal white-matter tracks involving arcuate fasciculus may be associated with psychotic features and auditory hallucinations in SZ.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac18" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Although equivalent current dipole source localization techniques work well to examine 50 and 100ms STG activity (Edgar et al., 2003, 2008; Huang et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2010), equivalent current dipole techniques are likely less optimal in terms of localizing auditory activity in non-STG areas, because activity in non-STG areas is often distributed and thus non-dipolar.</text></s>

Declaration of interest
The authors have no conflicts of interest to report.
In VESTAL (Huang et al., 2006), we take the lead-field based MEG source imaging approach and divide the source space (the brain volume or just the cortex) into a grid of a large number of dipole locations.
The M×N sensor waveform matrix B(t)=[b(t1),b(t2),…,b(tN)] contains MEG data where m is the number of MEG sensors and s is the number of time points, b(ti) is an M×1 vector of the MEG measurements at given time point.
For each column of B, we have:(1)Bt=GQt+Noisetwhere G is an M×2P gain (lead-field) matrix calculated from MEG forward modeling for the pre-defined source grid with P dipole locations, with each dipole location having two orthogonal orientations (i.e., θ and ϕ).
Q(t)=[q(t1),q(t2),…,q(tN)] is a 2P×N source time-course matrix.
In the spherical MEG forward head model, θ and ϕ represent the two tangential orientations for each dipole location.
In the present study, a realistic MEG forward model using the boundary element method (BEM) is used to calculate G (Huang et al., 2007; Mosher et al., 1999), and in BEM the θ and ϕ-orientations are obtained as the two dominant orientations from the singular-value decomposition (SVD) of the M×3 lead-field matrix for each dipole, as previously documented (Huang et al., 2006).
The BEM mesh was obtained from tessellating the inner skull surface from the MRI into ~6000 triangular elements with ~5mm size.
The noise term in Eq.
(1) is assumed to be Gaussian white noise.
If correlated noise exists, pre-whitening procedures can be applied (Huang et al., 2006; Mosher et al., 1999; Sekihara et al., 1997).
The inverse solution in Eq.
(1) obtains the source time-courses Q(t) for given MEG sensor wave-forms B(t).
In general, for each time-sample, since the number of unknown parameters is far greater than the number of sensor measurements (i.e. 2P≫M), MEG source imaging is dealing with a highly under-determined problem, and there are a large number of solutions that fit the data.
To reduce the ambiguity, additional constraints (source models) are needed.
The conventional minimum L1-norm solution selects the source configuration that minimizes the absolute value of the source strength.
Let G=USVT be the singular value decomposition of the gain matrix, the minimum L1-norm q that meets the following condition (Sekihara et al., 1999):(2)minwTq,subjecttoconstraintsSngVngTq≃UngTbwhere Sng, Ung, and Vng contain the ng largest singular values and the associated singular vectors, respectively.
In Eq.
(2), w is an 2P×1 optional weighting vector chosen to remove potential bias towards grid nodes at the superficial layer and it is usually taken to be the column norm of the G matrix (Matsuura and Okabe, 1997; Uutela et al., 1999) or a Gaussian function (Ioannides et al., 1993).
A major limitation with previous L1-minimum norm routines has been instability in spatial localization and poor smoothness in reconstructed source time-courses.
The time-course of one specific grid point can show substantial spiky-looking discontinuities.
This problem is also encountered in other focal localization methods using lead-field approaches.
To increase spatial and temporal stability, we developed a spatial-temporal vector-based minimum L1-norm solution (i.e., VESTAL).
The idea was based on a principle of MEG physics, which states that the magnetic waveforms in the sensor-space are linear functions of the dipole time-courses in the source-space.
If we perform singular value decomposition for the M×N MEG sensor waveform data matrix:(3)B=UBSBVBTone can see that all temporal information in the MEG sensor waveform can be represented as a linear combination of the singular vectors in the matrix VB.
Since MEG sensor waveforms are linear functions of the underlying neuronal source time-courses, the same signal sub-space that expands the temporal dimension of B should also expand the temporal dimension of the 2P×N source time-course matrix Q=[q(t1),q(t2),…,q(tN)] estimated from the vector-based minimum L1-norm solution for s time points.
In the present study, Q was solved using SeDuMi package (http://sedumi.ie.lehigh.edu/).
By projecting Q towards VB we can ensure that source time-courses matrix Q and sensor waveform matrix B share the same temporal information as requested by the MEG physics:(3)QVESTAL=QP||where the projection matrix P||=VBVBT is constructed using the dominant (signal-related) temporal singular vectors (subspace) of the sensor waveforms.
We called QVESTAL the Vector-based Spatial-temporal Analysis using L1-minimum-norm (VESTAL).
In VESTAL, the temporal information in the data is used to enhance the stability of the reconstructed solution.
Since this approach makes no assumptions about the temporal dynamics of the sources, the approach can handle sources that are 100% correlated.
More technical details of VESTAL, in which VESTAL was tested with computer simulations and human data, are presented in Huang et al. (2006).
Results show that VESTAL provides high spatial stability and continuous temporal dynamics, without compromising spatial or temporal resolution.
