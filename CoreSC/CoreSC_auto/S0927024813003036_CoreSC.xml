<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Some recombination is intrinsic (band-to-band and Auger), while other is determined by defects in the bulk or at surfaces.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>It is necessary to understand which defects are typically present in solar wafers before processing, and what effect processing has on those defects.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot2" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Moreover, it is important to understand the mechanism by which the relevant defects give rise to recombination, as well as to quantify their recombination activity.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res3" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Monocrystalline Czochralski silicon (Cz-Si) typically contains ~1018cm-3 of interstitial oxygen, which is mainly incorporated from the silica crucible which contains the melt.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res4" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This level of oxygen is supersaturated below ∼1200°C, so the equilibrium state is reached by the formation of SiO2 particles (oxide precipitates) [1].</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The morphology of such particles changes as they grow, from unstrained particles initially, to strained precipitates, which are eventually surrounded by dislocations and sometimes stacking faults [2,3].</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The first stage in precipitation is nucleation, and the rate of this is strongly enhanced by the presence of crystal defects.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In modern Cz-Si used for integrated circuits the grown-in defect concentration is insufficient for oxygen precipitation to occur unintentionally.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>However, even in the highest quality Cz-Si, oxide precipitates can nucleate upon prolonged annealing at 650°C to 850°C [1,4].</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In silicon for microelectronics thermal processes are often used to force oxygen precipitation to provide gettering centres for harmful metallic contaminants [5,6].</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>For photovoltaics, the Cz-Si wafers used are often of lower crystal quality, and several studies have found concentric rings of oxide precipitates in wafers or cells after growth or processing [7-10].</text></s>

<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac16" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Although it is possible to reduce intrinsic point defect concentrations to levels which are essentially negligible, doing so requires slow growth rates and these are not always compatible with the commercial constraints of the silicon photovoltaics industry.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con1" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thus, although the problem can in principle be eliminated, the fact is many commercial Cz-Si solar wafers do contain vacancy-rich regions in which oxide precipitates form [7-9].</text></s>

Extended versus point-like defects
<s sid="243"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res90" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It is interesting that although oxide precipitates and surrounding dislocations and stacking faults are extended defects, we find that their effect on bulk minority carrier lifetime is that expected from point-like defects.</text></s>

<s sid="254"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con33" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We have established that iron decoration of oxide precipitates strongly enhances the recombination activity, so for a fair comparison we need to account for the iron decoration.</text></s>

<s sid="256"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res94" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, from assuming all the recombination activity arises due to iron decoration, we have previously combined iron-loss measurements with the lifetime data to estimate αn1=2×10-6cm3s-1 and αn2=4×10-7cm3s-1 [23].</text></s>
<s sid="257"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res95" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This assumes that each iron atom at an oxide precipitate gives rise to one of each of Defect 1 and Defect 2.</text></s>

<s sid="261"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con36" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Under the assumptions stated above, the state density is the density of iron atoms at the oxide precipitates.</text></s>
<s sid="262"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con37" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The estimated residual minority carrier lifetime depends strongly upon doping level and injection level, with the lifetimes at high injection tending to the ambipolar lifetime.</text></s>
<s sid="263"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con38" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>At typical substrate doping levels for photovoltaics (∼1016cm-3), the lifetime in p-type material is higher than in n-type for injection levels at which the lifetime is not at the ambipolar limit.</text></s>

Competition between gettering systems
<s sid="268"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con43" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In silicon wafers for integrated circuits oxide precipitates and associated defects are frequently used as a way of internally gettering transition metal impurities, thus preventing the impurities harming the devices [5,6].</text></s>
<s sid="269"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj8" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>We performed phosphorus diffusion gettering on samples containing oxide precipitates, which enables us to assess the relative strength of the two gettering systems.</text></s>
<s sid="270"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res97" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For the results shown in Fig. 7, the bulk iron concentration was 1.4×1012cm-3 before gettering and 5.2×1011cm-3 after gettering, and Nαn terms associated with the oxide precipitates fell by ∼20%.</text></s>
<s sid="271"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con44" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>As we have shown that the Nαn parameters correlate with the iron lost to the precipitates (Fig. 8), we conclude that the bulk iron lost has not been gettered to the oxide precipitates, and has most likely been gettered to the phosphorus diffused layer.</text></s>
<s sid="272"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con45" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thus, for the conditions investigated, phosphorus diffusion gettering is more effective at gettering bulk iron than oxide precipitates.</text></s>
<s sid="273"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con46" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This is very encouraging from the perspective of solar wafers containing oxide precipitates and suggests that the recombination activities will not increase (and may decrease slightly) during the phosphorus diffusion gettering process.</text></s>
<s sid="274"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con47" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>It is also noted that our findings are consistent with those of Rinio et al., who found evidence to suggest that impurities are gettered preferentially to the emitter rather than native crystal defects in mc-Si [58].</text></s>
<s sid="275"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con48" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The correlation between iron loss and recombination activity shown in Fig. 8 implies that our analysis approach is capable of measuring very low relative concentrations of atomic iron at oxide precipitates.</text></s>
<s sid="276"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con49" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The results presented in Fig. 7 show that the states associated with oxide precipitates are reduced by ∼20% by the phosphorus diffusion gettering process used.</text></s>
<s sid="277"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con50" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>An explanation for this reduction is that this proportion of iron has dissociated from the oxide precipitates and surrounding defects.</text></s>

Conclusions
<s sid="279"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con52" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>As a consequence of using fast crystal pulling rates, some monocrystalline Cz-Si solar wafers contain vacancy-rich regions which act as preferential sites for precipitation of supersaturated bulk oxygen.</text></s>
<s sid="280"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con53" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Oxide precipitates and surrounding defects are associated with recombination activity, and this can have a substantial detrimental impact on the conversion efficiency of solar cells.</text></s>
<s sid="281"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con54" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We have used injection-dependent minority carrier lifetime measurements to study this recombination activity in ∼100 samples with different types, doping levels, precipitate morphologies and sizes.</text></s>
<s sid="282"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con55" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>In all cases we find the lifetime can be parameterised in terms of two independent defect states.</text></s>
<s sid="283"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res98" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The first defect is at EV+0.22eV and has a capture coefficient for electrons ∼157 times greater than that for holes.</text></s>
<s sid="284"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res99" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The second defect is at EC-0.08eV and has a capture coefficient for holes ~1200 times greater than that for electrons.</text></s>
<s sid="285"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con56" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The concentration of centres appears to scale with the density (not size) of the precipitates, with surrounding dislocations and stacking faults increasing the density of centres per precipitate.</text></s>
<s sid="286"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con57" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Remarkably, we find the same defect states in oxide precipitate-containing samples which have been intentionally contaminated with iron.</text></s>
<s sid="287"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con58" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The density of the states per precipitate is dependent on the iron loss from the bulk per precipitate.</text></s>
<s sid="288"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con59" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We therefore conclude that at least some of the recombination activity of oxide precipitates in &quot;uncontaminated&quot; samples is due to the segregation of iron to the precipitates and surrounding defects.</text></s>
<s sid="289"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con60" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We find that a phosphorus diffusion gettering process reduces the density of states associated with the oxide precipitates by ∼20%, and that bulk iron is preferentially gettered to the phosphorus diffused layer rather than to the oxide precipitates.</text></s>
