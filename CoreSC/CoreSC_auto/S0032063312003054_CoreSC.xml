Introduction
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Since the discovery that Mars has the remanent magnetisations of an ancient dynamo imprinted on its crust (Acuña et al., 1998), it has been conceivable that the otherwise non-magnetised planet could host mechanisms that energise plasma and accelerate particles, typically related to planets with strong intrinsic magnetic fields.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Indeed, in 2005 the Mars EXpress (MEX) Spectroscopy for the Investigation of the Characteristics of the Atmosphere of Mars (SPICAM) Ultra-Violet (UV) spectrometer (Bertaux et al., 2004) made the first observations of localised auroral emissions from the nightside atmosphere of Mars over regions of strong crustal magnetic fields (Bertaux et al., 2005).</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Further processes akin to a planet with a strong dipole magnetic field have been found in observations of magnetic reconnection (Eastwood et al., 2009; Halekas et al., 2009), and flux rope formation at Mars (Brain et al., 2010; Morgan et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The processes that occur at the low altitudes of the Martian ionosphere and also in the region of the crustal magnetic fields are far from being understood.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>As a result, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for the aurora that have been observed in the Martian atmosphere.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac9" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>In the case of planets with global dipole magnetic fields, such as the Earth, Saturn and Jupiter, auroral emissions occur as a result of atoms and molecules in the respective atmospheres undergoing excitation after collisions with precipitating electrons (McIlwain, 1960).</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac10" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>At the Earth auroral emissions appear in either diffuse or discrete forms.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met11" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The former results from electrons typically of plasma sheet origin moving along the Earth's magnetic field until contact is made with the upper atmosphere.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met12" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The precipitation of electrons from the plasma sheet is thought to occur mainly from pitch angle diffusion as particles interact with electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves (Johnstone et al., 1993; Villalón et al., 1995) or the scattering of electrons by whistler mode waves (Lyons et al., 1974; Horne and Thorne, 2000).</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met13" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The sharp, bright and discrete form of aurora occurs when the electrons responsible for the auroral emissions have been accelerated.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met14" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The type of acceleration most explored in research involves a quasi-static field-aligned potential drop that accelerate electrons over a narrow range in energy, thus forming what is known as a mono-energetic peak.</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met15" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The potential drop facilitates electrons transported over large distances via an upward current to reach the low altitudes where auroral emissions take place (Gurnett and Frank, 1973).</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac11" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>It has been established that this process occurs as part of a larger current system that closes through the Pedersen and Hall currents in the ionospheres and a return parallel current to a dynamo at higher altitudes (Johansson et al., 2006).</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>These current systems are responsible for transporting large amounts of energy and momentum within the magnetospheres of the magnetised planets and is therefore of great importance.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj1" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>For Earth and Saturn, the current system is powered by an external dynamo in the solar wind and for Jupiter the source is internal to the planet's magnetosphere.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Acceleration of electrons can also be observed over a wide range or broad band of energies, as associated with dispersive Alfvén waves (DAWs) (Ergun et al., 1998; Chaston et al., 2003).</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For the Earth, modelling by Newell et al. (2009), shows that diffuse aurora may account for 70% of the precipitating particle energy flux into the high-latitude ionosphere.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>SPICAM observes an auroral signal as a sudden increase in the intensity of the nightglow from the Martian atmosphere.</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met16" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Leblanc et al. (2006) have calculated this is most probably produced by electrons with a peak energy of a few tens of eV and not by electrons that have been accelerated.</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac12" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>This would suggest the aurora at Mars is more comparable to the Earth's diffuse aurora.</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Studies by Haider et al. (1992, 2007) and Seth et al. (2002), support such a possibility by demonstrating nightglow emissions at Mars would occur from the precipitation of unaccelerated solar wind electrons onto the atmosphere.</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Hyp1" novelty="None" type="Hyp"/><text>However, evidence has been mounting that the UV emissions observed by SPICAM at Mars could also be associated with similar processes that occur in regions of the cusp/polar magnetic field of the Earth during discrete aurora.</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The first such example was of peaked electron distributions on open magnetic field lines indicative of acceleration by a current system similar to that found during the Earth's discrete aurora (Brain et al., 2006).</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This was followed by the detection of an &quot;inverted-V&quot; shape in the energy-time distribution of electrons and ions, with electrons moving downward and ions upward in the high altitude deep shadow of Mars, indicative of acceleration and the current from a parallel electric field (Lundin et al., 2006a).</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Further observations then revealed density depletions alongside peaked electron distributions and beams of O+ ions that have a missing cold component, indicative of long-lived active auroral type flux tubes (Dubinin et al., 2009).</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Despite the similarities in the properties of accelerated particles found at Mars and the Earth, there is a great amount of uncertainty as to whether the observations at Mars are the result of a direct analogy with the auroral current systems of the Earth.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This is due to the difference of the Martian ionosphere, which has high values of Pedersen conductivity.</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Modelling by Dubinin et al. (2008b) shows that the high conductance of the Martian ionosphere would leave the electric currents that couple the Martian ionosphere and the induced magnetosphere prone to short circuit.</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp1" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>Previous attempts were made by Leblanc et al. (2008), to compare UV observations of Martian aurora by SPICAM in its nadir orientation with in situ electron and ion measurements by MEX Analyzer of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms (ASPERA-3) Electron Spectrometer (ELS) and Ion Mass Analyzer (IMA) instruments and electron content as measured by the MEX MARSIS Radio Sounder.</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The study found a very good correlation between the locations of aurora with regions that were least probable to be on closed field lines from the crust, as well as a simultaneous correlation to increased electron content and precipitating electron flux at these locations.</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>However, the SPICAM observations of the aurora did not show any corresponding ion signal from IMA measurements.</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This was possibly due to the lack of complimentary viewing direction between that of the SPICAM instrument with the aperture plane of IMA.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met17" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Previous studies of &quot;inverted-V&quot; signatures using ELS and IMA were restricted by an earlier energy table of IMA before May 2007, which did not adequately resolve ion measurements below 50 eV.</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met18" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>As a result, possible observations of heavy planetary ions as they begin to accelerate from low altitudes were missed.</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Without observing ion beams in conjunction with SPICAM UV observations of Martian aurora or in the low altitudes regions associated with the aurora, it is not possible to assess the current systems responsible for the Martian aurora and therefore to know with certainty that a similar mechanism for creating aurora at the Earth is present at Mars.</text></s>
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con3" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Hence, this paper will survey accelerated and unaccelerated electron signatures of electron precipitation as could lead to the Martian aurora, to assess the different mechanisms that lead to electron precipitation.</text></s>
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj2" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Using the ASPERA-3 ELS and IMA instruments we will compare the energy distributions in differential energy flux (DEF) of electrons and heavy-ions at the times of these signatures.</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The study will make use of IMA's updated energy table that allows for increased energy resolution of ion measurements below 50eV.</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj4" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>By comparing the energy distributions of electron and heavy-ions with the new energy table of IMA, we will search for evidence of upward flowing ion beams from peri-centre altitude, ∼275km, up to altitudes of 2200km and further evidence of Earth-like auroral acceleration processes and current systems around Mars.</text></s>
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A study by Nilsson et al. (2012), of average ion distribution functions around Mars, shows that there is a general outflow of ions from the Martian ionosphere, with greater amounts of cold plasma close to the planet.</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>On average, ions are observed flowing away and towards Mars.</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>In this study, we will look at the combination of energy distributions of electrons and heavy-ion during signatures of electron precipitation and will attempt to classify different types of particle distribution asymmetries.</text></s>

<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met22" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>ELS is located on the ASPERA-3 main unit, which uses a rotating platform to perform scans over different scanner angles.</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met23" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>For the first 2 years of MEX operation, the scanner did not move from its launch configuration, which was at a scanner angle of 90°.</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met24" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Since the scanner motion and for the purpose of this study, most data is obtained with the scanner offset angle of 10°.</text></s>
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met25" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>In this position the ELS sector 0 and sectors 12-15 look out over the spacecraft.</text></s>
<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa3" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>The effect is that these anodes give less integrated flux of electrons compared to unobstructed anodes when observing what should be an isotropic feature of electrons.</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa4" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>For the purpose of this study, we have chosen to interpolate across the spacecraft viewing ELS sectors rather than exclude the data.</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa5" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>This is to compensate for the bias that would result from having sectors with no observations of electrons.</text></s>
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met26" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>IMA measures ions of energies 0.01-40keV/q for the main ion components H+, H2+, He+ and O+, and the group of molecular ions (20-80amu/q).</text></s>
<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met27" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>IMA measures ions using a deflecting electrostatic analyser system to resolve the energy of the incoming ions and then uses a magnetic filter, which deflect and separate ions over 32 mass channels.</text></s>

<s sid="93"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met33" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The first distribution is referred to as the heated model (dotted line) since the accelerating potential is kept at 0eV and the electron temperature (Te) is increased until a curve of best fit is found.</text></s>
