Introduction
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod4" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>This paper is a companion to Part I (Kakimpa et al., in press), in which a robust, coupled CFD-RBD (Computational Fluid Dynamics-Rigid Body Dynamics) model is developed.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod5" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The model is shown to be capable of predicting the unconstrained free flight of plate-type debris.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod6" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>The present paper takes that model and applies it to two cases.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod7" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Firstly, the model has been used to investigate the influence of the plate's initial orientation, Tachikawa number, mass moment of inertia and geometric parameters, such as thickness-ratio and aspect-ratio, on the trajectory of the plate.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod8" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>This first case will be referred to as the &quot;Free flight Simulations&quot;.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod9" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Secondly, the model has been applied to debris that is launched from the building envelope and whose subsequent flight is influenced by the flow field in the locale of the building.</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod10" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>This second case will be referred to as &quot;complex launch conditions&quot;.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj2" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The Introduction of Part I describes the rationale behind the need for better understanding of the flow processes that occur during the flight of wind borne debris.</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Here, we concern ourselves with a review of the literature appropriate to these complex launch conditions.</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj4" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Damage assessment reports of extreme windstorms in the UK, such as the Birmingham Tornado in 2005 (Marshall and Robinson, 2006) have revealed a definitive link between damage to downstream property and windborne debris generated from upstream structures.</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs2" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>This pattern, illustrated in Fig. 1 is referred to as the debris damage chain (Minor and Beason, 1976; Holmes, 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="31"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs3" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>With reference to the upwind building in Figs.</text></s>
<s sid="32"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs4" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>1 and 2 shows the sequence of roof failure.</text></s>
<s sid="33"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs5" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>A large suction at the upwind eave of the gable roof produces partial lift-off of tiles.</text></s>
<s sid="34"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod11" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Lift off then continues as the wind gets under the roof, creating a positive pressure which assists the suction on the outside of the roof.</text></s>
<s sid="35"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod12" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>Two possibilities then occur: the peeling off of tiles across the roof or the entire roof structure being blown off.</text></s>
<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Later, Lin et al. (2006) extended the early work by Holmes (2004) on compact debris to plate-type debris.</text></s>
<s sid="37"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>Model experiments and full-scale tests on plates were conducted and the plate's mode of motion was observed, together with measurements of plate trajectory, and velocities, all of which are affected by the wind field, model characteristics, and initial support configuration.</text></s>
<s sid="38"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa2" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>More significantly, however, further experimental studies have recently been performed, mainly focused on investigating the effects of atmospheric turbulence and complex launch conditions on debris flight.</text></s>
<s sid="39"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Visscher and Kopp (2007), Kordi et al. (2010) and Kordi and Kopp (2011) have recently undertaken pioneering experimental work involving a destructive wind tunnel modelling approach that more realistically represents the unsteady force coefficients on the plate which change dramatically as the panel lifts off of the roof, leaving a hole beneath.</text></s>
<s sid="40"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The experiments also included a simulated turbulent atmospheric boundary layer.</text></s>
<s sid="41"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj5" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>This work has provided some insights into the influence of initial conditions (i.e. the fixing conditions and complex flow environment around the plate initially mounted on a roof) and flow turbulence to the mechanics of plate flight.</text></s>
<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj6" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Visscher and Kopp (2007) studied a 1:20 scale, aero-elastic &quot;failure&quot; model of a roof panel on a scaled house in a scaled, open country, turbulent boundary layer.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj7" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>The panel was held on the roof of the house with electromagnets which applied a restraining force.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs6" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>For similar initial conditions, Visscher and Kopp (2007) observed different modes of flight including translational, autorotational and intermediate modes.</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs7" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The translational mode was observed 75% of the time, while the autorotational mode was observed 25% of the time.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs8" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Translational trajectories were found to have a short range with less scatter, resulting in less dispersion in the landing location, while autorotational trajectories were far more variable in landing location.</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>An initial overturning failure was observed for every test although the results were noted to be dependent on hold down strength, panel mass and size as well as the angle of attack of the wind and the house geometry.</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Visscher and Kopp (2007) suggest that the effects of variability of the flow field on the resulting aero-dynamic normal forces play a critical role in determining the flight mode and this is probably most significant during the initial overturning and the first few moments thereafter.</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>They conclude that the sensitivity to particular flight conditions appears to be greater even than indicated by Baker (2007) when actual panel failures are considered.</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Visscher and Kopp (2007) also found the speed at which sheathing panels fly to be a fraction of the mean wind speed and was calculated as 0.60 with standard deviation of 0.08 for the translational mode, and 0.70 with standard deviation of 0.12 for the autorotational mode for the particular panel, wind angle, roof location and hold-down force examined.</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj8" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Kordi et al. (2010) and then Kordi and Kopp (2011) applied the same failure model approach to investigate the effect of varying wind direction, debris properties and the surrounding neighbourhood structures.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs9" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>They observed that with oblique wind approach angles relative to the roof ridge, complex 3D spinning was the most dominant mode of flight and that the mode of flight was dependent on the approaching wind direction.</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Comparisons with the theoretical asymptotic limit from analytical models revealed conflicting results for different debris types with shingles flying close to the theoretical asymptotic limit speed while tiles did not.</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The present work is broken down into the aforementioned sections the first dealing with free flight, the second with complex launch conditions.</text></s>

CFD model and cases
<s sid="56"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The setup of the CFD model is described in detail in Section 3, Part I (Kakimpa et al., in press), which includes a detailed description of the CFD-RBD coupling.</text></s>
<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In the first series of 36 simulations (hereafter Batch 1) the plates were held at initial angles of attack in the vertical XY plane, αz=90°-ψ, ranging from -85° to 90° at intervals of 5° (Fig. 3).</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Notice an increase in ωz corresponds to an increase in ψ and is of an opposite sense to the angle of attack.</text></s>
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The plates were held normal to the flow in the horizontal XZ plane for these simulations.</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res21" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>A second series of 41 simulations (hereafter Batch 2) were performed with the plate rotated at 15° intervals about the Z-axis and the Y-axis such that its initial orientation is no longer normal to the flow.</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs10" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>In these cases, an initial orientation, ψ, about the Z-axis is applied, followed by a second rotation θ about the Y-axis.</text></s>
<s sid="62"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res22" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These two rotations would correspond to a pitch followed by a yaw of the plate.</text></s>
Debris flight modes
<s sid="63"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res23" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Batch 1 simulations resulted in no significant lateral crosswind motion even though plates were free to translate and rotate in the crosswind direction.</text></s>
<s sid="64"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs11" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>The debris trajectories for Batch 1 cases can be categorised into three distinct modes of flight; Flutter, Transitional and Autorotational.</text></s>
<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs12" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Fig. 4 illustrates the corresponding modes observed for various initial angles of attack.</text></s>
<s sid="66"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res24" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The asymmetry of mode behaviour about αz=90° initial orientation is attributed in part to the contribution of the plate's vertical velocity, which affects the effective angle of attack.</text></s>
<s sid="67"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mod13" novelty="None" type="Mod"/><text>In the discussion of the various flight modes that follows, several figures are presented which contain the non-dimension parameters: the horizontal non-dimensional distance, Kx⋆=Kxg/U2 and the non-dimensional time, Kt⋆=Ktg/U.</text></s>
<s sid="68"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met1" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>The coordinates x, y and z used in these non-dimensional variables are in the fixed inertial reference frame (i.e. in the global coordinate system of the CFD domain)-they are not in the plate's local reference frame.</text></s>
Flutter11
<s sid="69"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Met2" novelty="None" type="Met"/><text>Andersen et al. (2005) used the term &quot;fluttering&quot; to describe the motion of free-falling plates and the mechanism described here has similar traits.</text></s>
<s sid="70"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res25" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>is mainly translational and is observed for plates with an initial angle of attack in the range 70°&lt;αz&lt;95°.</text></s>
<s sid="71"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res26" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>As shown in Fig. 5(a), the rotational motion of fluttering plates is characterised by oscillations between positive and negative values of ω¯z.</text></s>
<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res27" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Values of ω¯z generally remain within the range ω¯z&lt;|ω¯o|, where ω¯o is the stable autorotational speed, which for a plate with the mass and inertia under consideration here is approximately 1.0 as shown by the dotted lines in Fig. 5.</text></s>
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res28" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Kordi et al. (2010) called this mode &quot;translational&quot;, but flutter is considered more descriptive.</text></s>
<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res29" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This value of ω¯o is higher than the CFD-RBD and experimental fit predictions of ω¯o≈0.70 for a fixed-axis autorotating plate of similar dimensions (Kakimpa et al., 2010; Martinez-Vazquez et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="75"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res30" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This may be attributed in part to the additional non-linear effects due to the presence of periodic fluctuations in the magnitude and direction of the mean wind speed relative the plate in the free-flight cases, while in the fixed-axis autorotational simulations the mean wind speed is kept constant.</text></s>
<s sid="76"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res31" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The amplitude of ω¯z increases from one cycle to the next for fluttering plates, and given a long enough flight duration, plates in the flutter mode would eventually reach ω¯z≈ω¯o and transition into stable autorotation.</text></s>
<s sid="77"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res32" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Transitional behaviour is observed for plates with an initial angle of attack in the range 45°&lt;αz&lt;70° or 95°&lt;αz&lt;140°.</text></s>
<s sid="78"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs13" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>These transitional mode plates initially exhibit oscillations between positive and negative values of ω¯ but eventually enter into stable autorotation when ω¯z≈ω¯o as shown in Fig. 5(b).</text></s>
<s sid="79"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res33" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Based on the results from fluttering and transitional plates, it might be postulated that provided the flight duration is long enough and the mass moment of inertia of the plate is sufficiently large to allow plate autorotation, a free-flying plate will enter into autorotation at a stable value of ω¯o, regardless of the initial orientation.</text></s>
<s sid="80"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res34" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Plate geometry and mass moment of inertia are therefore crucial parameters in determining whether plate autorotation occurs.</text></s>
<s sid="81"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res35" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, the rotational direction and time required to reach stable autorotation are found to be strongly dependent on the initial orientation of the plate.</text></s>
<s sid="82"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res36" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It could be argued that flutter and transitional plates are essentially the same classification.</text></s>
<s sid="83"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res37" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For the proposed classification to make sense, the flight time is crucial-if the plate enters an autorotational state (for even a single rotation) before it lands, then it can be termed transitional.</text></s>
<s sid="84"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res38" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This assumes that it has undergone at least one reversal of its rotational direction before autorotation sets in.</text></s>
<s sid="85"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res39" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Autorotational flight occurs for -35°&lt;αz&lt;45°.</text></s>
<s sid="86"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs14" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Plates rotate with either positive or negative angular velocities from the start, with no change in rotational direction during the simulation, and quickly reach the stable autorotational speed, ω¯o, as shown in Fig. 5(c).</text></s>
<s sid="87"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res40" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The plate's rotational direction is strongly influenced by initial orientation, with plates having an initial orientation in the range -35°&lt;αz&lt;0° exhibiting ω¯z&gt;0 while plates with initial orientation 0°&lt;αz&lt;45° have ω¯z&lt;0, where the positive sense of rotation is shown in Fig. 3.</text></s>
<s sid="88"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res41" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It should be noted, however, that due to the high initial positive lift experienced by plates with initial angle of attack, αz&gt;0°, in contrast to the negative lift experienced by plates with initial angle, αz&lt;0°, the plates with a positive initial angle of attack are observed to fly further, Fig. 6(c), for the flight durations considered.</text></s>
<s sid="89"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res42" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This is despite having a lower horizontal velocity, u¯=u/Uw, as can be seen in Fig. 7(c).</text></s>
<s sid="90"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res43" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It can be seen from the slopes of the lines in Fig. 6(c), that plates with negative initial angle of attack would in fact catch up with the positive initial angle of attack plates and subsequently fly further, if released from a higher point above the ground.</text></s>
<s sid="91"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res44" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In all three modes, the terminal vertical velocity of the plate is found to be relatively independent of initial orientation.</text></s>

<s sid="95"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res46" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>These CFD-RBD results reveal that existing assumptions, in some models, that u¯ has an asymptotic limit of 1.0 are in fact incorrect and need to be re-evaluated.</text></s>
<s sid="96"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res47" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Kordi and Kopp (2009) have identified that the limit may be above or below 1, depending on the sense of rotation.</text></s>
<s sid="97"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res48" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This coupling between the rotational direction and the terminal plate horizontal speed can be explained by the presence of autorotational drag, lift and torque.</text></s>
