<s sid="105"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con20" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thus, the major part of stage C is considered to arise from the shrinkage of nanovoids at high temperatures.</text></s>
<s sid="106"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con21" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Indeed, the shrinkage of nanovoids in Cu by self-diffusion in this temperature range is well documented from early studies of transmission electron microscopy of coarse-grained Cu in which nanovoids were generated by precipitation of quenched-in vacancies (see Bowden and Balluffi [34]).</text></s>

<s sid="110"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res52" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Assuming isotropic annealing, the dilatometric length change in stage C minus the contribution from removal of grain boundaries corresponds to a change volume ΔV/V0=3×Δℓ/ℓ0 in the range of 1×10-3, which is smaller than that from the radiotracer experiments by a factor of 2-3.</text></s>
<s sid="111"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con22" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The different amounts of porosity estimated from the tracer technique and in the present dilatometric annealing experiments therefore indicate that only part of the porosity is annealed out up to the maximum annealing temperature of 673K - especially since the percolating porosity detected by the tracer method may be considered as the lower limit of the total porosity.</text></s>
