Introduction
<s sid="6"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac1" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Hydrogen (H2) is a promising alternative energy carrier not only because it can potentially achieve zero-carbon emission at the point of use, but also because H2 has a high energy density (33.3kWh/kg) compared to hydrocarbons (12.4-13.9kWh/kg) [1].</text></s>
<s sid="7"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac2" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>The major scientific challenge for on-board H2 applications is that of inventing effective and efficient H2 storage materials, and there is an ever-increasing worldwide interest in meeting the United States Department of Energy's (DoE) H2 storage targets of 5.5wt% gravimetric and 40gL-1 volumetric by 2017.</text></s>
<s sid="8"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>It is important to note that the DoE targets refer to storage within the whole system rather than within the storage medium alone, with a target operating temperature of -40 to 60°C and an operating pressure below 100atm.</text></s>
<s sid="9"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot1" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Although solid-state H2 storage based on chemisorption and physisorption has been extensively studied over recent years, so far no material is able to meet this DoE target thus presenting a major impediment for the realisation of the &quot;Hydrogen Economy&quot;.</text></s>
<s sid="10"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot2" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Nevertheless, physisorption of molecular H2 based upon the non-dissociative interaction in porous solids is an especially attractive option since it shows fast kinetics and favourable thermodynamics over multiple adsorption and release cycles [2].</text></s>
<s sid="11"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obj1" novelty="None" type="Obj"/><text>Thus, enormous efforts have been focused on developing new porous solid materials for high capacity H2 storage.</text></s>
<s sid="12"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res5" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Metal-organic framework (MOF) complexes are a sub-class of porous solids which show great promise for gas storage and separation due to their high surface area, low framework density, and tuneable functional pore environment [3].</text></s>
<s sid="13"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res6" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>MOF materials are usually built up from metal ions or clusters bridged by organic linkers to afford 3D extended frameworks with the formation of cavities ranging from microporous to mesoporous region.</text></s>
<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Obs1" novelty="None" type="Obs"/><text>Several members within this MOF family have achieved impressively high H2 adsorption capacities (albeit at cryogenic temperatures, typically at 77K) [4] with a record of ∼16wt% total uptake capacity observed in NU-100 [5] and MOF-200 [6].</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res7" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, these high uptake capacities drop dramatically with increasing temperature, and thus none is a practical material.</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot3" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>There is thus particular emphasis on optimising the interactions between MOF hosts and adsorbed H2 molecules, and the identification of specific binding interactions and properties of gases within confined space represents an important methodology for the development of better materials that may lead us to systems of practical use.</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Goa1" novelty="None" type="Goa"/><text>In situ neutron powder diffraction (NPD) at below 10K has been used previously to determine the locations of D2 within a few best-behaving MOF materials incorporating exposed metal sites [7-12].</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>It has been found that D2 can bind directly to vacant sites on metal centres, and that the adsorbed D2 molecules have molecular separations comparable to that to D2 in the solid state.</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>These studies have provided invaluable structural rationale for their observed high gas adsorption capacities.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" type="Bac"/><text>Research has thus focused understandably on MOFs with high H2 uptake capacities, while materials showing very low H2 uptake and/or incorporate fully coordinated metal centres are often ignored for this study.</text></s>
<s sid="21"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Mot4" novelty="None" type="Mot"/><text>Therefore, information on binding interactions within those low-uptake MOF systems is entirely lacking, but can still give important complementary data and potential understanding for the subsequent design and optimisation of hydrogen storage materials.</text></s>
<s sid="22"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res8" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>It is critical to the success of the NPD technique that the MOF complex adsorbs a significant amount of D2 to boost the observed signal.</text></s>
<s sid="23"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con2" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This technique therefore has disadvantages when studying the binding interaction within MOFs with low uptakes.</text></s>
<s sid="24"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con3" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Furthermore, static crystallographic studies cannot provide insights into the dynamics of the adsorbed gas molecules.</text></s>
<s sid="25"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Thus, it is very challenging to probe experimentally the H2 binding interactions within a porous host system which has very low gas uptake due to the lack of suitable characterisation techniques.</text></s>
<s sid="26"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>We report herein the application of the in situ inelastic neutron scattering (INS) technique to permit direct observation of the dynamics of the binding interactions between adsorbed H2 molecules and an aluminium-based porous MOF, NOTT-300, exhibiting moderate porosity, narrow pore window and very low uptake of H2.</text></s>
<s sid="27"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con6" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This neutron spectroscopy study reveals that adsorbed H2 molecules do not interact with the organic ligand within the pore channels, and form very weak interactions with [Al(OH)2O4] moieties via a type of through-spacing interaction (Al-O⋯H2).</text></s>
<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Interestingly, the very low H2 adsorption has been successfully characterised as weak binding interactions and, for the first time, we have found that the adsorbed H2 in the pore channel has a liquid type recoil motion at 5K (below its melting point) as a direct result of this weak interaction to the MOF host.</text></s>

Inelastic neutron scattering

<s sid="36"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Exp7" novelty="None" type="Exp"/><text>The sample was degassed at 10-7mbar and 120°C for 1day to remove any remaining trace guest solvents.</text></s>

<s sid="42"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The Al(III) ion in NOTT-300 has an octahedral coordination environment with six oxygen atoms, four of which are from carboxylate groups and two of which are hydroxyl groups, giving an [AlO4(OH)2] moiety.</text></s>
<s sid="43"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con7" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>These aluminium oxide moieties are further linked to each other via the corner-sharing hydroxyl groups μ2-OH.</text></s>
<s sid="44"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Al(III)-carboxylate MOFs are usually constructed from the 1D aluminium oxide chains linked by the carboxylate ligands (Fig. 1(c)) [14-19].</text></s>
<s sid="45"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res12" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Two distinct types of aluminium oxide chains have been reported previously.</text></s>
<s sid="46"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res13" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The aluminium chain in MIL-120 is composed of [AlO2(OH)4] octahedra linking to each other via a common edge defined by two μ2-(OH) groups [14].</text></s>
<s sid="47"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res14" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The different positions of the common edge in the two crystallographically distinct Al sites induce a cis-trans connection mode of the octahedral units, and thus zigzag chains are generated.</text></s>
<s sid="48"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res15" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The aluminium oxide chains in MIL-53 and MIL-118 are composed of [AlO4(OH)2] octahedra linked to each other via vertex-sharing μ2-(OH) groups [16-18].</text></s>
<s sid="49"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res16" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>In both case, the connections of the [AlO4(OH)2] octahedra adopt trans configurations, generating straight, rod-like aluminium building blocks.</text></s>
<s sid="50"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res17" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Depending on the coordination mode of the carboxylate groups, the aluminium chains in MIL-53 and MIL-118 show small differences in linkage of the octahedral nodes.</text></s>
<s sid="51"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res18" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>However, in NOTT-300 the corner-sharing [AlO4(OH)2] octahedra in the aluminium oxide chains display a cis configuration, and in order to accommodate the hydroxide groups, adjacent [AlO4(OH)2] octahedra are rotated by 90o with respect to each other, thereby generating 41 screw axes.</text></s>
<s sid="52"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res19" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This type of connection is distinct from the other two examples, and, therefore, represents a new type of aluminium oxide building block (Fig. 1(c)).</text></s>
<s sid="53"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res20" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The chirality of the NOTT-300 framework therefore arises from the formation of helical chains of [AlO4(OH)2] octahedra induced by the cis-configuration of μ2-OH groups.</text></s>
<s sid="54"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con8" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>This overall connectivity affords a porous extended framework structure with square-shaped 1D channels with hydroxyl groups protruding into them, endowing the pore environment with free hydroxyl groups over four different directions (Fig. 1(b)).</text></s>
<s sid="55"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con9" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The diameter of the channel window, taking into account the van der Waals radii of the surface atoms, is approximately 6-7Å.</text></s>

<s sid="57"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res22" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The H2 isotherm (Fig. 2) at 77K for NOTT-300 shows exceptionally low adsorption uptakes (26ccg-1 or 0.22wt%), albeit NOTT-300 shows very high uptakes of CO2 (3.30Å) and SO2(4.11Å), both of which have a larger kinetic diameter than that of H2 (2.89Å).</text></s>
<s sid="58"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res23" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>The uptake of H2 increases sharply in the low pressure region and reaches saturation at ∼1bar.</text></s>
<s sid="59"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con10" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>By using the pore volume of NOTT-300 and the liquid density of H2 at its boiling point (20.3K), it is estimated that NOTT-300 can hold a maximum of 2.7wt% H2 (302ccg-1) at saturation.</text></s>
<s sid="60"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con11" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Surprisingly, the experimental uptake is 10 times lower than this estimation, suggesting that NOTT-300 has unusually weak binding interaction to H2 molecules, even though the pore size of NOTT-300 (6-7Å) is believed to be optimal to afford strong overlapping potential to H2 molecules and thus boost the adsorption uptakes.</text></s>
<s sid="61"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res24" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>This anomalous H2 adsorption behaviour motivated us to further investigate the interactions between adsorbed H2 molecules and NOTT-300 host, and thus to understand its very low uptake.</text></s>

<s sid="64"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con12" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>INS is a powerful neutron spectroscopy technique which has unique advantages in probing H2 binding interactions by exploiting the high neutron scattering cross-section of hydrogen (82.02barns) [20].</text></s>
<s sid="65"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res27" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>As a result, the INS spectrum is ultra-sensitive to the vibrations of hydrogen atoms and the rotations of the hydrogen molecule, with hydrogen being ten times more visible than other elements.</text></s>

<s sid="72"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res33" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Because quantum mechanical restrictions of the symmetry of the wave-function are responsible for the existence of both species, transitions between them are forbidden in optical spectroscopy, but in the case of INS the transitions between p-H2 and o-H2 are allowed because the neutron can exchange spin states with the molecule.</text></s>
<s sid="73"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res34" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>For p-H2 in the solid state, the environment is isotropic and the main rotational transition is J(1←0) that manifests itself as a very sharp peak at 14.7meV (Fig. 3(e)).</text></s>
<s sid="74"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res35" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Such a peak has also been observed on high loadings of H2 on MgO thin films, indicating that H2 molecules are not interacting with the material surface [25].</text></s>

<s sid="102"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res44" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Furthermore, INS studies on MOF-5, in which the Zn(II) centres are also fully coordinated by oxygen donors to form a [Zn4O(O2CR)6] building block, show two distinct peaks at 10meV and 12meV, which are attributed to H2 interactions with oxygen atoms from the [Zn4O(O2CR)6] building block and with the benzene ring, respectively [21,30].</text></s>
<s sid="103"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res45" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>Consistent results were also obtained from DFT calculations of H2-loaded MOF-5, where the adsorbed H2 molecules are found to interact most strongly with the [Zn4O(O2CR)6] clusters and least strongly with the benzene rings [31].</text></s>
<s sid="104"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con26" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The peak at 8.8meV in the spectra for NOTT-300·nH2 (n=0.5,1.0) in this study is entirely consistent with the INS peak (10meV) observed for MOF-5, confirming that the adsorbed H2 molecules in NOTT-300 are interacting with [Al(OH)2O4] moieties (Fig. 4).</text></s>
<s sid="105"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con27" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>Due to the space constraints and the possible repulsive interaction with the active hydroxyl groups μ2-OH around [Al(OH)2O4] moieties, this site is saturated very quickly upon H2 loading consistent with the observed low uptake capacity.</text></s>
Conclusions
<s sid="106"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con28" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>INS studies on the H2-loaded material NOTT-300 have revealed the detailed binding interaction within this system.</text></s>
<s sid="107"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con29" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The adsorbed H2 molecules in NOTT-300 are found to have recoil motion along the pore channel with freedom to rotate in all directions, reminiscent of the behaviour of liquid H2.</text></s>
<s sid="108"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con30" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>[Al(OH)2O4] moieties within the channel can only provide binding interactions to few H2 molecules and reach saturation quickly consistent with the experimentally observed low H2 uptake for this material.</text></s>
<s sid="109"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Con31" novelty="None" type="Con"/><text>The unusually low uptake of H2 in this study is related to the quantum effect of H2 which has a very low molecular mass [32] and the very weak interaction between the H2 and the NOTT-300 host is thus not sufficient to overcome this quantum effect, and therefore very little H2 is taken up by this porous material.</text></s>
<s sid="110"><CoreSc1 advantage="None" conceptID="Res46" novelty="None" type="Res"/><text>We have also confirmed that the ultra-low H2 uptake is not due to incomplete activation or MOF decomposition as the desolvated MOF shows very high CO2 uptake with a measured pore volume close to that of the single crystal pore volume.</text></s>
