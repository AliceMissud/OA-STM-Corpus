<s sid="10"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac3" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>These pluripotent cells have the unique characteristic to self renew in vitro while maintaining the capacity to differentiate into a broad number of cell types.</text></s>

<s sid="14"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Obj" conceptID="Obj3" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>Nevertheless, the practical, financial and temporal obstacles in producing and validating personalized clinical-grade hiPSC and their differentiated progeny will almost certainly limit the feasibility of this approach.</text></s>
<s sid="15"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac4" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>These limitations could selectively restrict patient access to autologous cell-based therapies (Faden et al., 2003).</text></s>
<s sid="16"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac5" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>The creation of clinical banks of hiPSC from donors that can provide HLA matching to recipients is proposed as a strategy to attenuate the host immune response to transplanted tissue (Lin et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2005, 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="17"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac6" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>Similarly, hiPSC can be used to develop in vitro disease models, allowing large scale studies otherwise restricted due to the limited availability of primary cells and biopsy material.</text></s>
<s sid="18"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac7" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>This application has been proven useful to model neurodegenerative diseases, cardiac syndromes and metabolic disorders in vitro for basic studies and drug screening (Ebert et al., 2009; Moretti et al., 2010; Rashid et al., 2010).</text></s>
<s sid="19"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Mot" conceptID="Mot3" novelty="New" advantage="None" /><text>However, each of these applications requires large quantity of hiPSC produced in reproducible and standardized ways.</text><text>However, each of these applications requires large quantity of hiPSC produced in reproducible and standardized ways.</text></s>
<s sid="20"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac8" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>Indeed, expansion of hiPSC remains time and resources consuming while experimental variability due to human intervention is almost systematic.</text></s>

<s sid="28"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac13" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>Finally, passaging represent the main difficulty to develop an automation platform to expand hiPSC since these cells must be propagated as aggregates/clumps to maintain their integrity and quality (Beers et al., 2012).</text></s>
<s sid="29"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac14" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>Indeed, evidence indicates that hiPSC grown and harvested as single cells are more likely to acquire genetic anomalies (Amps et al., 2011).</text></s>
<s sid="30"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Bac" conceptID="Bac15" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>Consequently, standardization of cell counting and cell clump size measurement has proven to be impractical.</text></s>

<s sid="104"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con4" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>This observation showed the importance of leaving the unattached cells in an undisturbed condition and that even the slightest movement can result in a heterogeneous distribution of the colonies.</text></s>

<s sid="107"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res9" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>These analyses showed high levels and homogenous expression of pluripotency markers and morphology characteristic of hiPSC for both manual and automated protocols (Fig. 3).</text></s>
<s sid="108"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res10" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>In addition, capacity of differentiation toward the three germ layers was confirmed by growing the hiPSC into culture conditions inductive for endoderm, mesoderm and neuroectoderm differentiation.</text></s>
<s sid="109"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Res" conceptID="Res11" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>Both manual protocols in T25 flasks and the automated protocol in T175 flasks showed homogeneous differentiation of hiPSC into the three germ layers as observed by the change of cell morphology and by the expression of endoderm markers: SOX17 and EOMES, mesoderm markers: BRACHURY and MIXL1 and neuroectoderm markers: NESTIN and SOX2 (Fig. 4).</text></s>
<s sid="110"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con5" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>These results suggest that cells expanded with our automation protocol retain the capacity to produce cell types with a clinical interest.</text></s>
<s sid="111"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con6" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>Considered together, these data suggest that the transfer of protocols between the two facilities was successful and that both scale-up and automation protocols were shown to maintain cell function comparable to manually passaged hiPSC.</text></s>
Conclusion

<s sid="114"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con8" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>Cells maintained their characteristic hiPSC morphology and expressed pluripotency markers both by immunochemistry and qPCR.</text></s>
<s sid="115"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con9" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>Additionally, these cells maintained the capacity to differentiate into the three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm and neuroectoderm).</text></s>

<s sid="118"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con12" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>With respect to future automated solutions incubator design must take into account the current necessity of not disturbing cells that require to be grown as aggregates, such as hiPSC and that take time (potentially up to 24h) to attach.</text></s>
<s sid="119"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con13" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>Automation would most certainly benefit from development of (conical) plastic vessels of the volume necessary to accommodate cell suspensions from T175 flasks as this could reduce the time for cell clumps to settle and thus speeding the passaging protocol.</text></s>
<s sid="120"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con14" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>The option to use a pipette with smaller bore than a 10ml pipette would assist the optimization of breaking cell clumps to the desirable size and reduce the single cell debris caused by pipetting.</text></s>
<s sid="121"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Con" conceptID="Con15" novelty="None" advantage="None" /><text>While these modifications would be required to optimize the present protocol to ensure maximum yields of cells, this study represents a proof of principle that hiPSC can be expanded in clumps using automation without loss of quality.</text></s>
